                            <div class="govuk-details__text">For BFR assessment purposes it is assumed that development will only happen on the PDL element of site (and not the larger, wider site which includes extensive tracts of Greenfield). To derive these estimates it has been calculated that only 30% of the wider site is PDL so 70% of the overall site has been discounted for development, hence the minimum figure propsed of 46 net dwellings used.. Previously assessed through SHLAA as site 1165.

Site was previously occupied by a Children's Care Home which closed in July 2002 and was demolished thereafter. 

Site was subject to a previous application for 28 dwellings (KET/2007/0990) which Committee resolved to grant permission for (subject to S.106) albeit this was never completed and the application was disposed of by the Council in September 2012.
