This assessment is based on all materials currently stored on site being removed. The former stables are likely to contain droppings from pigeons and other vermin, which will present a health hazard to demolition workers, and must be removed in a controlled manner. Wooden doors and other items are probably coated with lead paint. Careful control of dust during demolition will be necessary. It is recommended that an asbestos survey of the buildings be conducted prior to demolition. On removal of the demolition rubble and existing floor slabs, it is recommended that the Site soils be inspected and photographed for signs of undetected on site contamination, particularly of oil spills.".

                            <div>"The site is proposed to be allocated in the DaSA for some 40 dwellings, of which 30% are affordable. Access should be achieved off Harbour Road. Screening employing native species should be provided on the boundaries of the site. Development should not adversely impact upon the neighbouring Rye Harbour SSSI. The site lies within Flood Zone 3a so any scheme will be subject to both the sequential and exception tests. Habitable rooms should not be provided on the ground floor. Dwellings should be flood resilient/resistant. Furthermore, essential infrastructure should be designed and constructed to remain operational and safe in times of flood. Given the commercial history of the site there may be contamination in the ground. The water table is particularly shallow beneath the surface of the site (within 1-2 metres) and could be leeching of contaminants from other areas of the estate. A proposal would have to undertake a land contamination assessment with any planning application that demonstrated any risks could be managed appropriately through the re-development process. Regard should be given to the setting of the Grade II listed School House and Grade II Church of the Holy Spirits located west of the site.

                            <div>“This brownfield site is part of a larger site that includes greenfield land. The whole site, including the greenfield part, is an “Amber” site in the Council's 2013 SHLAA and a development of some 20 dwellings should include 30% affordable housing. The site is at high risk and is poorly defended from tidal flooding and would be subject to Sequential Test and Exception Test. The Environment Agency (EA) has also indicated the site will also be dependent on the Eastern Wall flood defence coming forward (programmed 2020/22). The site lies on Tidal Flat Deposits underlying Hastings Beds. Tidal Flats Deposits are classed as unproductive strata and the Hastings Beds are classed as a Secondary A aquifer. The EA advises a proposal would have to undertake a land contamination assessment with the planning application that demonstrated any unacceptable risks could be managed appropriately through the re-development process. The EA has also advised that how foul water is disposed to ground in the area is important due to the shallow groundwater and very limited attenuation that would occur in the unsaturated zone above the water table. See page 26 of the SHLAA (http://www.rother.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=20276&p=0)."</div>

Development of the site should be through a comprehensive masterplan and should focus on an accessible, sustainable and high quality leisure hub facility, creating a landmark leisure destination through high quality buildings and public realm on this highly prominent gateway site into the town."</div>
