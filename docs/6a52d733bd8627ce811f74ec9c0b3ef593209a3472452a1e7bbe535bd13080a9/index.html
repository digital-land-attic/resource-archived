Allocated as a deliverable key housing site in Local Plan Policy H2 (Key Housing Sites). This allocation is proposed for retention in Policy H2 of the Regulation 19 consultation draft of the Local Plan Review document. This site was subject to a planning permission for 59 residential units which has now expired (CR/2012/0223/FUL). Since the grant of planning permission CR/2017/0974/FUL a prior approval scheme of 44 dwellings (CR/2019/0271/PA3, granted 28/05/2019) and an associated application to extend the building upwards with 9 further apartments (CR/2019/0681/FUL, granted 06/08/2020) have been approved.</div>

There are a significant number of trees within the site particularly along the frontage and rear. The adjoining woodland is a Site of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCI). The impact of any development on trees within and adjoining the site would need to be considered and this is likely to constrain the siteâ€™s capacity. Any development is likely to be limited to the footprint of the existing ambulance station although there may be potential for a three storey building providing there is sufficient clearance to the adjoining tree canopies. The yield of the site would be subject to a formal assessment of trees. Minimum figure of 5 units reflecting lower threshold for inclusion of site in the Register. Maximum figure of 16 is based on the figure given in the Local Plan Housing Trajectory. Planning permission CR/2020/0274/FUL for 44 flats is currently pending determination.</div>
