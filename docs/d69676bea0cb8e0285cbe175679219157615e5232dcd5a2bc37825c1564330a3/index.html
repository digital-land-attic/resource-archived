The site was previously been subject to a bid to the HCA for Starter Homes funding and it was assumed that 40 dwellings could be delivered on the site. However, as part of an urban design review, consideration was also made of higher densities (flats) being deployed on site and assuming 100dph an alternative yield of 63 dwellings has been assumed.</div>

Council owned site. Preference would be for affordable housing on site.

Different dwelling capaciites have been calculated for the site dependent on potential densities to be applied (taking account of the surrounding area). These entail either 17 houses at 50dph or 12 houses at 35 dph and these values take account (exclude) an area of the site under which a sewer easement runs.. A sewer easement crosses the site.</div>

Site was previously occupied by a Children's Care Home which closed in July 2002 and was demolished thereafter. 

Site was subject to a previous application for 28 dwellings (KET/2007/0990) which Committee resolved to grant permission for (subject to S.106) albeit this was never completed and the application was disposed of by the Council in September 2012.
