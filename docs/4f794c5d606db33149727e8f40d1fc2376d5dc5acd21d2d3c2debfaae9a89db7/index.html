If the planning permission includes land that is greenfield then the 'MinNetDwellings' figure only refers to dwellings in the planning permission on Brownfield Land. Where there is no planning permission 'MinNetDwellings' is (at 2018-12-22) an estimate based on a density calculation undertaken by the authority informed by site analysis and expressed in the Plymouth and South West Devon Joint Local Plan Submission document, (as amended by major modifications), in accordance with the DCLG document 'Brownfield Land Registers Data Standard: Preparing and publishing a register' by showing 'The minimum net number of dwellings that the local authority estimates the site should support'. Where there is no planning permission and 'NetDwellingsRangeFrom' is used the figure in 'NetDwellingsRangeFrom' equals the figure in 'MinNetDwellings'. Where there is no planning permission and 'NetDwellingsRangeTo' is used, the figure in 'NetDwellingsRangeTo' is estimated at 10% higher (rounding up) than 'MinNetDwellings'.".
