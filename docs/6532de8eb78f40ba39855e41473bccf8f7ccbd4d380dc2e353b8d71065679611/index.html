Approval of reserved matters for 166 dwellings (17/00247/RM, Phase 1) on the west side of the site pursuant to outline planning permission 08/01085/OL. This was followed by another approval of reserved matters for 63 dwellings (19/00025/RM) which partially amended the layout approved under 17/00247/RM. This added a further 5 dwellings to the 166 houses. A Reserved Matters planning application for 97 dwellings (19/00705/RM, Phase 3) has been submitted (and approved in Nov 2019). In September 2019, two further Reserved Matters applications have been submitted; one for 156 dwellings (19/00962/RM, Phase 2) and another for 165 dwellings (19/00903/RM, Phase 4). However, Phase 2 is on Greenfield land, therefore overall housing figure on pdl reduced to 669 dwellings. 36 out of 825 dwellings have been completed in the first two years. It is expected that 30 dwellings will be completed per annum in 2019/20 and 2020/21, and 60 dwellings per annum from 2021/22 onwards, based on two housebuilders on site.|http://www.ne-derbyshire.gov.uk/index.php/your-council/document-library/local-plan-exam-library/03-supporting-docs-evidence-base/housing/2292-eb-hou6b-housing-sites-appendix-c/file</div>

This brownfield land represents only the north western part of the scheme in North East Derbyshire. Since planning permission was granted on site, the Government has confirmed proposals for the realignment of the proposed route for HS2, such that it runs through the eastern end of the Coalite site affecting residential development. The impact of this creates significant uncertainty for the approved scheme and the council cannot be confident that the housing development will come forward. However, in light of the proposed realignment of HS2 the developer has applied for an outline application for B1c, B2 and B8 uses (19/00925/OL) which is currently pending. The council will await the outcome of this application. If permission is granted the council would ask the developer for confirmation of their intention before withdrawing it from the register.|http://www.ne-derbyshire.gov.uk/index.php/your-council/document-library/local-plan-exam-library/03-supporting-docs-evidence-base/housing/2292-eb-hou6b-housing-sites-appendix-c/file</div>
