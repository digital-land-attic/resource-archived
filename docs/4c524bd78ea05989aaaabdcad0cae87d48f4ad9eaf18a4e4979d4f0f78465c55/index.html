Cross boundary site with Lichfield District.  Recently closed power station which is due to be decommissioned.  Potential for mixed use redevelopment.  Consultation on Supplementary Planning Document recently undertaken (July-September 2017) which identified potential for predominately employment uses within Cannock Chase District and residential development within Lichfield District.  However, work is ongoing in relation to identifying an appropriate mix of uses for the site.  It is therefore included within the Register in recognition of the cross boundary residential development and the unknown capacities/uses within Cannock Chase District at this time.</div>
