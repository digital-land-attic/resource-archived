                            <div>The site is identified in the 2015 Local Plan Housing Trajectory as a suitable and developable site for residential development, and is identified as 'deliverable' in the Housing Trajectory supporting the draft Regulation 19 consultation Local Plan Review document. There are a significant number of trees within the site particularly along the frontage and rear. The adjoining woodland is a Site of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCI). The impact of any development on trees within and adjoining the site would need to be considered and this is likely to constrain the site’s capacity. Any development is likely to be limited to the footprint of the existing ambulance station although there may be potential for a three storey building providing there is sufficient clearance to the adjoining tree canopies. The yield of the site would be subject to a formal assessment of trees.. http://www.crawley.gov.uk/pw/web/PUB353205</div>
