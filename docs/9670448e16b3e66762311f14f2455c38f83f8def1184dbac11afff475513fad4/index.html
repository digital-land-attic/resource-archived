                            <div>The site is located within the BUAB of Henfield and is close to existing services and facilities.  Some of the land is in public ownership and the owners have indicated their willingness for development to come forward, demonstrating that the site is available for development.  There may be potential for this site to be allocated within the Neighbourhood Plan for Henfield.  It is considered that any commercial use or potential loss of parking spaces would need to be considered prior to any development on this site, and as a consequence the likely maximum number of dwellings the site could deliver would be around 6 units. The site is also located in Henfield Conservation Area and the Post Office is a Grade II listed building.  Access to Henfield library would also need to be maintained.   Any development of this site would be likely to take place in a single phase</div>

                            <div>This site is located in the built-up area of Horsham and is accessed from Rusper Road. Planning permission for 24 flats was granted in 2002 for 24 flats, (NH/157/02) but was not implemented. This permission expired in 2010, but the landowner has indicated that they would like the site to remain in the SHLAA, indicating that the land is available for residential development. The site area of this land extends beyond the original planning permission to include additional units.  This extended area increases the potential of the site to 30 dwellings. Given that the permission was not implemented, further work may be required to bring this site forward and the site is considered available and suitable for development 6-10 years. A scheme of this size would likely be delivered in a single phase</div>

                            <div>The site is located within the settlement of Bucks Green and surrounded by linear residential development.  The site is currently used as a public house, however the landowner has expressed an interest to develop the site meaning it is available for development. Any loss of the public house would however need to be considered through the development management process, but a small amount of residential development may be suitable in the longer term provided it is compliant with local policy and does not harm the setting of the Fox Inn which is a listed building. This site will need to be considered as part of the emerging Neighbourhood Plan for Rudgwick</div>

                            <div>This site is located in the Storrington High Street, and is situated in a designated Conservation Area.  At the current time the site is not available for development given the use of the site as a Post Office depot, but it is considered that there is potential for the site to come forward in the next 15 years.  This site is identified as a reserve site in the pre-submission (Regulation 14) draft of the Storrington, Sullington and Washington Neighbourhood Plan and the supporting text in relation to the draft policy indicates that the development would be expected to deliver in the region of 10 dwellings in a Courtyard development.  The shopping frontage would need to be retained as part of any development. In addition to preserving and enhancing the Storrington Conservation area, any development would also need to consider potential impacts on the Air Quality Management Area which has been declared for this part of Storrington.</div>

                            <div>An outline application for the demolition of existing squash club facility and erection of 9 flats with associated car parking (DC/15/1992) was refused in May 2017 on the grounds that it had insufficient parking. In principle infilling development within BUAB's is acceptable provided it is of an appropriate nature and scale. The site has therefore been assessed as Developable 6-10 years subject to the parking issue being resolved as part of subsequent applications. This may be through a smaller scheme than the 9 proposed for this application. The proximity of this site to the Conservation Area would mean that any design on this site would need to be designed sensitively and the loss of community facilities and any mitigation would also need to be reconsidered as part of any future application</div>
