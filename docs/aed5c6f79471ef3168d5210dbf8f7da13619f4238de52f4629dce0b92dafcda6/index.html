The site has also been utilised as a scrapyard in the past. Peripheral to Alnwick, being located outside settlement boundary. An application was refused for erection of 1 dwelling on part of site, with the subsequent appeal dismissed (15/02778/FUL). Brownfield element (0.48ha) - indicative yield of around 5 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach, although likely to represent the maximum appropriate. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 0018) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 1.27ha. Any proposal for development should reflect setting. Recently confirmed that the site is available for redevelopment, with intention to propose a scheme of 5 dwellings in due course. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

Whilst latterly utilised as offices and a warehouse, the building had originally been a row of cottages. The identified yield of 7 homes is based on a historic planning permission that lapsed without being implemented (A/92/A/174). This would have reversed the earlier works, returning the building to residential use. Earlier permissions for conversion and demolition lapsed and were refused. It has recently been confirmed that this site is no longer available for a housing scheme. No future residential development is now forecast from the site.</div>

Rural location but opportunity for potential redevelopment of limited part of large site. The reduced yield indicated recognises potential suitability for small scale development of 10 units. The site has been the subject to other small-scale projects on discreet parts of the site, identified on separate SHLAA sub-parcels (0115a, 0115b). This includes renovation of the listed station building to form a single dwelling and redevelopment of the former engine shed to create a further dwelling (11/00726/FUL). Another application was permitted for conversion of the goods shed to a dwelling (14/02689/FUL). Further opportunity exists on remaining brownfield land, likely to be through new-build development. Recently confirmed that the site remains available with a redevelopment scheme to be considered in due course. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

Another vacant building lay to the west of the site, although the whole site has now been cleared. The site has long been identified for redevelopment and a range applications for redevelopment were made prior to this, including proposals to redevelop for retail use. This includes an application for a supermarket refused after being called-in by the secretary of state (A/2001/0331). Two independent proposals for redevelopment have been progressed since clearance, with two sub-parcels identified to reflect this. The western parcel (0220a) now has planning permission for 9 dwellings (17/02409/FUL). Development yet to commence but forecast for completion within the next 5 years. Also note recent development of a supermarket and another small retail unit on the adjacent land (0220b) - now completed (13/02550/FUL).</div>

Potential opportunity for conversion and new-build on site. Planning permission in place for a total of 19 units (16/03770/FUL). The proposal involves a complex range of works, including partial demolition of various buildings and modern extensions and the refurbishment, alteration and conversion of remaining buildings, including Allerburn House and The Lodge. This will create 10 dwellings with new-build development providing a further 10 homes. A later application to replace some of the conversion proposals with additional new-build was refused in 2018 (18/02811/FUL). Subsequently, the original scheme has been amended to reduce the overall total to 19 homes, but retaining the emphasis on conversion. Development has now commenced and completion is forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

Available for redevelopment, with a scheme likely to involve conversion of the main Grade II listed building and potentially some new-build. Overall site identified as having potential for 72 homes a total that is reflective of a predominantly residential area. An application for redevelopment is currently pending consideration for a mix of conversion, part demolition and redevelopment of the site (19/00500/FUL). This involves a proposal to provide a total of 98 additional residential units across the wider site through conversion of the Grade II listed former school buildings to create 27 residential apartments and development of 49 elderly living accommodation apartments and 22 residential dwellings. Brownfield element (0.80ha) only relates to the northern part of the site - a yield of around 22 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 0282) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 4.79ha. If the current application is permitted, the deliverability of development will be reappraised. The BF register will also be updated to outline a yield of 27 units from by the conversion aspect of this proposal.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Vacant Grade II listed building within Alnwick town centre that dates from 1862 and has been utilised for a number of purposes over the years. After the original use ceased, the building continued as cinema, and then bingo hall, until closure in 1986. It has now been vacant unoccupied for a number of years. Situated behind the main row of buildings in Market Street, access will be a key constraint to overcome. Yield reflects urban infill opportunity at relatively high density, most likely provided through conversion to apartments. A scheme will have to be reflective of and sensitive to the listed building and surrounding heritage assets. Previous planning permission lapsed for change of use from a cinema to public house (13/02501/FUL). A much earlier permission for a mixed-use scheme, including residential development, similarly lapsed (A/90/A/210). Any future proposals for residential development proposals are likely to incorporate two adjacent parcels of land within the same ownership (0285, 0286). Recently confirmed by the land owner that the site is available and work is currently underway to develop proposals for the whole area. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

The site is also part occupied by an existing dwelling. An initial outline application was permitted in 2005 (A/2003/0576). A reserved matters consent followed for demolition of the existing house and construction of 9 dwellings in replacement (A/2008/0289). The proposal will result in the net gain of 8 dwellings on completion. Development has commenced. A further application for construction of 1 dwelling was approved in 2014 (14/00205/FUL). This relates to part of the wider site and is identified as the replacement for the former dwelling, which has already been cleared (known as plot 9). Despite there being no substantive progress to date on the residential aspect of the development, the permission has been implemented through initial site works, so it will not lapse. Completion is forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

However, the last occupants, an IT firm and a textiles company, vacated following a fire in 2006. After this incident, a redevelopment scheme was progressed. An initial application was for a mixed-use scheme, creating 33 flats, retails and office accommodation through a combination of conversion and restoration of listed former industrial buildings alongside new-build development, was permitted in 2007 (A2006/0557). The proposed works comprise of the conversion, alteration and restoration of the listed Bolams Mill, to create 6 apartments and commercial space at ground floor level, the listed Malthouse Kiln to create 3 dwellings and ground floor commercial space, with construction of 24 flats on a part of the site that had previously been cleared. This initial permission was subject to an application to make an amendment, removing the proposal for office and commercial space and creating an extra 4 flats, thereby increasing the overall yield to 37 dwellings (17/03197/FUL). This superseded an initial proposal for redevelopment. Scheme of 37 dwellings completed in 2019/20.</div>

Steady build-out programme has been continuing over a number of years and is now reaching conclusion, with only 1 dwelling now outstanding. Forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

Offers a highly attractive location for new housing at Amble harbour. A higher density flatted scheme may be fitting to maximise the location and potential. This land had been included as part of proposals for redevelopment of a much larger site. Earlier permission included provision for 127 apartments and associated retail and office development, but lapsed without implementation (A/2006/0500). A revised scheme construction of 17 apartments, in three 5-storey blocks, as part of a mixed-use redevelopment permitted (13/03731/FUL). This only related to this particular parcel. It also included construction of commercial units providing a mix of retail and office space (A1, A2, B1). Development of 17 dwellings completed in 2017/18.</div>

Now vacant and offering a good opportunity for redevelopment, in a potentially attractive location for new homes. The identified yield is considered appropriate for urban location. Demolition of the former industrial complex was undertaken following earlier consent (04/B/0368). A permission for building of 30 units was then secured (04/B/0337). This permission remains extant, following the construction of an access road. Therefore although the residential aspect of development has not commenced, the consent has been technically implemented, Deliverability in the short-term has been questioned and there has been no recent indication that development is likely to recommence. Not currently deliverable and it is anticipated that it is more likely to be a developed in the medium- to longer-term.</div>

Brownfield in part (0.19ha) - indicative yield of around 6 dwellings appropriate for this parcel. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 1043) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 0.38ha. Previous proposal relating to wider site for 4 dwellings following clearance was not taken forward and permission has now lapsed, despite renewal (N/02/B/0588, N/06/B/0029). Another application for a scheme of 2 units was refused (N/06/B/0559). This excluded the clearance of the storage buildings and related to a smaller site area. The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Site within Berwick town centre, historically occupied by a brewery, then a museum, but latterly now disused. A range of industrial and commercial buildings remain on-site, all now vacant and somewhat dilapidated. The site lies immediately adjacent to the Grade II* listed Governor's House and, although not directly impacted by the proposal, it remains important for context and setting. The complex comprises of 12 discreet but largely inter-connected buildings. Some of these require demolition prior to redevelopment of the site. The history of this site is linked to an associated but geographically separate parcel of land to the north (1046b). An initial application for 66 dwellings covered both site and was permitted in 2011 (06/B/0714). Since then, the two schemes have largely progressed independently, essentially as two phases to a wider development. However, the two parcels remained linked and are being delivered by the same developer. This record is for phase-1. Specifically for this parcel, the original permission was for selective demolition of redundant non-listed buildings and construction of 15 new-build homes, alongside the alteration and conversion of a Grade II listed former pottery to create 6 further dwellings. The conversion element was also subject to separate listed building consent, first permitted in 2009 and renewed in 2012 (06/B/0719, 12/01222/LBC). Phase-1 of the scheme has now been delivered, after a development of 21 dwellings was completed in 2016 (1046a). There has been no progress to date with the residential aspect of phase-2 (1046b). However, the extant permission for the remaining 37 dwellings will not lapse, as the permission has been implemented. Taking account of amendments to the original scheme, the overall scheme will see the delivery of 58 dwellings on final completion. Phase-1 one completed in 2016/17. Phase-2 is forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

Occupied by a range of buildings and associated hardstanding. Relocation of the business to new premises would be required to enable redevelopment, as would subsequent demolition of the existing buildings. A scheme has been proposed in the past. Application for clearance and development of 40 homes previously permitted but has now lapsed (07/B/0304). A subsequent application to renew this consent was withdrawn (11/02912/FUL). The lapsed consent was for 40 homes but a yield of 25 units is identified through the SHLAA, which is considered more appropriate for the setting, location and market. An existing business remains operating from the site and there has been no recent indication of relocation and/or change in circumstances.

A previous permission for conversion to provide 9 apartments lapsed without implementation, despite renewal (06/B/1002, 10/B/0121.). This scheme involved part demolition and alteration of the existing building. Indicative yield is of a relatively high density, but reflective of conversion scheme for flats and fitting for location. The demolition aspect of the works was subject to a separate approval (06/B/1003). The immediate availability of the site is uncertain. It is considered to still have potential in the longer-term, but residential development is forecast later in the plan period.</div>

The demolition of the unused warehouses and office buildings would be required before a scheme could progress. The site has been identified for mixed-use redevelopment of a number of years. An application for development of a retail unit was permitted (10/B/0192). Another scheme was then permitted for conversion and change of use from haulers yard to agricultural merchants, retail unit and a cafÅ¥ (13/01053/FUL). Both of these lapsed without commencement, However, a recent application for clearance of the site and development of a distillery complex, including a retail shop, cafe and visitor centre, has been permitted in 2019 (18/03870/FUL). Works are now underway. As a result, this site is no longer available for redevelopment for residential use and no future development is now forecast.</div>

Site offers opportunity for extensive redevelopment of railway land, adjacent to ECML, and yield considered to reflect urban location. Access limitations would need to be successfully overcome by a successful scheme and remediation likely to be required due to historic use. The site has a long running planning history and has been subject to an number of earlier proposals. An initial application for 120 homes was refused (N/08/B/0926). A revised scheme for 71 homes was permitted in 2012 but has now lapsed (11/02030/OUT). A reserved matters application relating to this outline approval was submitted but then withdrawn (15/01307/REM). Recently confirmed that the site remains available for redevelopment and a new scheme is currently being considered by the landowner. Currently considered developable later in the plan period. The site is now identified as an allocation in the Reg. 19 Local Plan (submitted 2019) .</div>

A small-scale residential scheme, appropriate for the setting ,as part of a limited cluster of development, could be suitable. This could be through conversion, selected clearance and new-build, or a combination of both. The current assessment of suitability in the SHLAA will be reviewed following adoption of the Local Plan. Previously local authority owned but the site has now been sold and there has been no recent indication of future plans. The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

Mixed site but any development would be limited to the footprint of the former buildings with the playing fields to be excluded. Brownfield in part (0.72ha) - indicative yield of around 19 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 1129) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 1.36ha. Recently confirmed that the site is available and is being considered for a residential scheme. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Originally railway land adjacent to the ECML, this site has been utilised as a builders yard and for open-air storage in more recent times.. Occupied by a range of traditional stone buildings, including a former engine shed, all being vacant and unused hardstanding. The location within Tweedmouth lends itself to a proposal of a relatively high density given the urban setting. Demolition and clearance required prior to redevelopment. Remediation also likely due to previous use. Initial demolition works were permitted a number of years ago but were never undertaken (09/B/0397). The site has deteriorated during the time unoccupied and the buildings are now derelict. An application for demolition of derelict former railway buildings and construction of 60 dwellings recently permitted (19/04107/FUL). This will provide specialist accommodation in the form of an extra-care facility and standalone houses. The scheme comprises a three-storey block, providing a 52 residential units (C3), along with 8 additional bungalows. Development yet to commence. Approved post-31 March 2020, with deliverability will be reviewed in the next 5-YHLS update.</div>

Redevelopment would involve the demolition of the redundant building prior to new-build scheme. A higher density development could be suitable given the central location, potentially a flatted scheme. A previous permission for 11 flats lapsed without commencement (12/01670/FUL). Related applications for demolition also approved but similarly works were not progressed (05/B/0272, 12/01671/CON). Recently confirmed that the landowner is still considering options for the site and is looking forward to bringing forward a scheme in near future. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

Highly rural location, but relates to a historic industrial complex. The building dates from 1805 but this had been the site of a corn mill for centuries. Whilst not formally listed, the main building is of heritage importance and forms part of a coherent group of former industrial buildings and worker's cottages. Initial permission was granted for conversion of the ground-floor to a single dwelling in (01/B/0588). Works commenced but halted for a revised scheme to be put forward. A subsequent application for conversion of the whole building to provide 5 flats was approved in 2009 (09/B/0449). This superseded the original proposal and remains extant. On completion, the works would deliver 2 flats at ground-floor level and 3 further flats in the upper floors. The permission has been implemented and will not lapse, but there has been no progress evident in recent years. The outstanding yield is not currently considered to be deliverable. However the likelihood of development in the medium- to longer-term is still considered to remain.</div>

The conversion of the building could offer opportunity to provide residential flats, potentially alongside other uses. A number of proposals for redevelopment have been made of the years. Two parallel applications for demolition of the cinema and construction of a building providing ground floor retail units with apartments were refused in 2006 (N/06/B/0606, N/06/B/0609). A revised proposal for alteration and conversion of the existing building to create 20 apartments was then granted, but lapsed despite extension (N/07//B/0747. N/10/B/0099). The latest proposal is for conversion of the vacant building providing retail and commercial at ground-floor level and a hotel above, approved in 2016 (16/01675/FUL). Works now underway. As a result, this site is no longer available for redevelopment for residential use. No future development is forecast.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Extensive tract of industrial land previously occupied by a wide range of industrial and commercial buildings, as well as some terraced residential properties. The vast majority have been cleared and the land is largely vacant and somewhat derelict in parts. Potentially offering an excellent and attractive location for development within the urban area. Clearance of any remaining remnants of past uses and also remediation would be necessary. A mixed-use development of the site, for 136 homes, retail floorspace and restaurant/cafe units, was permitted in 2014 after being considered for a number of years (09/B/0317). Despite there being no substantive progress to date on the residential aspect of the development, the permission has been implemented through initial site works, so it will not lapse. A revised application for construction of 136 homes, alongside a parallel application for demolition of remaining buildings, was submitted in 2012 (12/00512/FUL, 12/00515/CON). These two linked applications remain pending consideration, and technically are live, but this has been the case for a some time and there has been no evidence of recent progress towards determination. Given the planning history, deliverability of site is uncertain in the immediate future but longer-term potential is still considered to remain.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Industrial and commercial land in Spittal. Occupied by a range of existing buildings, largely vacant, but some of which are part occupied by temporary tenants. The premises include two Grade II listed former smokehouses, some more modern commercial blocks and also an existing dwelling. Opportunity exists for redevelopment, likely to involve a combination of conversion of some buildings, demolition of others, and new-build construction. Planning permission is now in place for development of 13 units after selected clearance (15/03346/FUL). Works proposed involve demolition of Herrings Yard and the low-quality dilapidated 1960s industrial buildings to the north of the site. The latter are in disrepair and considered an eyesore. The listed smokehouses to the south of the site will see work to form a wing of one of the residential properties. The final element is for works to the existing residential property and corner office, which will be retained and renovated. Development yet to commence but forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

Offers opportunity for redevelopment, potentially through conversion, new-build after clearance, or a combination of the two. Site has an extensive planning history over many years. An application for conversion to a residential care home, was refused in 1996 (N/93/B/0335/P). This was followed by another refusal for conversion to 7 dwellings (N/95/B/0687/P). Permission was then granted in 2001 for alteration and conversion of the hotel to create 7 dwellings, but this lapsed without being delivered (N/01/B/0206). Some time afterwards, Before this, an application for demolition of vacant hotel and construction of 12 homes was refused (14/03794/FUL). An appeal was dismissed in 2016. A revised scheme for demolition of an existing dwelling and construction of 2 semi-detached homes and then part demolition, conversion and extension of the hotel to 8 flats was then permitted (17/02068/FUL). This permission has yet to be implemented. Finally, in 2019 permission was granted for an alterative scheme, involving part demolition, alteration, conversion and extension of the vacant hotel and associated outbuildings to create 9 apartments (19/01481/FUL). Both the 2017 and 2019 permissions remain extant, although it is expected that the most recent permission will be implemented and delivered. Development yet to commence but forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

Revised application, also for demolition and construction of 30 dwellings, now permitted (18/04099/FUL).. A separated consent has been issues for demolition works (19/01505/DEMGDO). Brownfield in part (0.21ha) - indicative yield of around 6 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach.

Demolition of the depot and associated buildings will be required, alongside remediation of the whole site.

Immediately adjacent to A68, with access needing careful consideration. Whilst at the edge of settlement a small-scale development is considered appropriate for the setting. Demolition, clearance and remediation will be necessary if a scheme for new housing was to progress. Currently in use and not immediately available but the site has been proposed for redevelopment in the past. Permission for development of 8 dwellings was secured but lapsed (T/20070552). Previously identified as an allocation in the draft Local Plan (submitted May 2019). It has recently been confirmed that this site is no longer available for a housing scheme. No future residential development is now forecast from the site. A modification to delete the allocation has been proposed during the Local Plan EiP.</div>

An existing business remains operating from the site and there has been no recent indication of relocation and/or change in circumstances.

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Site within Haltwhistle occupied by a range of uses, with a number of existing buildings remaining in situ and elements vacant. The north of the site consists of light industrial units and associated land, latterly being occupied by a number of car repair workshops, storage buildings and a haulage depot. They are likely to require clearance before any substantive residential development can take place. Potential need for remediation given past use. There are also two existing dwellings to the south of the site. The identified yield of around 35 dwellings reflects development at an appropriate density given setting. There is a very complex planning history, with a number of scheme previously proposed for redevelopment, as a whole or in part. An initial application for 65 dwellings was refused (T/20061470). Revised proposals were then development. These consist of 2 parallel proposals for alternative schemes. An application for demolition of 2 existing dwellings and a number of light industrial buildings and construction of a 57 flat sheltered housing complex and a further 9 detached homes was permitted (T/20080131). The proposal would result in 64 net additional homes on completion. Another application for a similar scheme, but consisting of 55 flats and 9 dwellings and associated facilities, was permitted at a similar time and later renewed (T/20070559, T/20100529), Ultimately, both of the approved schemes have lapsed. There have also been a number of applications for small-scale residential schemes to the south of the site, including permissions enabling construction of the 2 existing dwellings,. as well as other scheme that were never implemented. The immediate availability of the site is uncertain. It is considered to still have potential in the longer-term, but residential development is forecast later in the plan period. The indicative yield is a reduction on previous proposals, but recognises likelihood of a more mainstream housing development rather than a sheltered care scheme.

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Town centre site that was formerly occupied by a number of buildings, most of which have been cleared, with a single three-storey building and a historic ropery now remaining. The old ropery offers opportunity for conversion. Now vacant following relocation of the facility and identified as a key redevelopment opportunity in the heart of Hexham. There will be opportunity for a higher density development in this location, probably an apartment scheme. Proposals for mixed-use redevelopment have been made on a number of occasions over the years, in part and incorporated within a wider scheme with adjacent land (2258, 2497). This planning history goes back over a long period. Permission for demolition of the remaining building and construction of 17 apartments and a retail unit, was initially secured for this parcel but lapsed (T/20061115). A revised application for a complex mixed-use scheme of residential development and retail, commercial and office floorspace was permitted but again lapsed without commencement (15/02794/FUL). A total of 36 dwellings were proposed, comprising of 5 houses and 31 apartments in three blocks. The proposal included part demolition, reconstruction, alteration and conversion of the existing buildings. It has recently been confirmed that the site is available and a revised scheme is going to be proposed in due course. Currently considered developable later in the plan period. Any future redevelopment is likely to be in combination with adjacent land (2258, 2497). The potential yield is recorded against the former bus station record (see 2497).</div>

The site has stood vacant for some time and now comprises of overgrown hardstanding. Offers chance for extensive redevelopment at the heart of the settlement. An outline permission was approved on closure (T/20050571). Reserved matters consent was then permitted for 65 units, but lapsed without being taken forward (T/20071304). Potential still exists for a residential scheme, potentially with some flatted development at an increased density given the central location in Bellingham. It has been suggested that the site could provide affordable homes and/or specialist housing accommodation, necessary in this rural location. Recently confirmed that the landowner intends to market the site for housing. Identified as an allocation in the Reg.19 Local Plan (submitted May 2019).</div>

Demolition of the garage building and remediation required prior to redevelopment. A number of scheme have been proposed to this effect over the years. An initial proposal for 7 units was refused (T/20060983). An outline consent was then permitted for 6 units, but lapsed (T/2007137).This was followed by permission for a similar scheme, 6 units following clearance that, similarly lapsed (.13/03434/FUL). Finally, an application for demolition the vacant garage and construction of 9 flats was permitted in 2017 (17/01547/FUL). The development would be of a block of self-contained flats (C3), providing assisted living for young adults with learning disabilities, alongside supporting facilities. The property is to be managed by a registered social landlord. This revised permission is now being delivered. Development of 9 dwellings completed in 2019/20.</div>

The redevelopment of the vacant school buildings was completed in 2016 following permission for alteration, conversion and extension to create a single dwelling (14/00717/FUL). The remainder of the site comprises of hardstanding, former car parking and playground areas adjacent to the former school building. A number of proposals have been submitted in the past. An initial outline application for 12 dwellings was refused (T/20050579). A revised scheme, also for construction of 12 dwellings in the grounds of the former school, was then permitted in 2007 but lapsed (T/200664079). Opportunity is still considered for a residential development, noting the context of the isolated location. The lower yield reflects this. Recently confirmed that the current landowner will consider options for redevelopment in due course. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.

The facility is no longer operations but a range of industrial buildings and associated infrastructure and storage land remains. Despite peripheral setting there could be scope for redevelopment through a small-scale residential project on part f the land. The overall SHLAA site is mixed in nature but the reduced yield indicated recognises a focus on the brownfield parcel. Brownfield element (0.49ha) considered to be suitable for small-scale development - a yield of around 5 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (2379) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 0.84ha. A saved Tynedale Local Plan allocation for 10 dwellings covers part of site. The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">The former goods yard at Haltwhistle station, comprising vacant hardstanding, some of which is overgrown. The land as been out of use for a number of years, with the most recent use being as open-air storage, but remains in Network Rail ownership. The Tyne Valley railway line is immediately to the north and River South Tyne adjacent to south.. Setting offers a potentially attractive location for residential development, although some constraints of access are identified. Remediation also likely due to former use. Outline permission for residential development of up to 50 homes was secured previously but has now lapsed (T/20041143). A subsequent application submitted in 2011 to extend this but was eventually disposed without determination (11/00905/FUL). Saved Tynedale Local Plan allocation for 30 dwellings also covers site . Whilst the previous consent was for up to 50 dwellings, a reduced indicative yield of 30 units is identified in the SHLAA, appropriate given the setting and site constraints. Recently confirmed that the land is available for redevelopment and that a proposal for a revised residential scheme is to be considered again. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Extensive, isolated derelict industrial land formerly home to the Marley Tiles factory. Comprises of a large industrial site in the countryside, which has been out of use since closure of the factory in 2008. The former factory and office buildings are in very poor repair and the site is largely derelict. The site has been identified and proposed for redevelopment for a number of years. The remaining buildings and industrial infrastructure require demolition prior to being redeveloped, as part of a significant clearance of the whole site. An initial application for residential development was refused as long ago as 2000 (T/20000109). A revised proposal to construct 109 houses following clearance has been refused in 2019 (18/02239/FUL). This proposal was focused on the brownfield element of the site, the footprint of the factory buildings and associated hardstanding. Notwithstanding this recent refusal, potential may exist for a residential scheme, but at an appropriate scale for the setting. Being a mixed site of both brownfield and greenfield land, the much reduced yield of 20 dwellings indicated in the SHLAA recognises development of discreet parcel of overall brownfield land (3.49ha). For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 2470) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 20.93ha. Potential may still exist for residential development, but a scheme will have to overcome the significant constraints and concerns highlighted and be of any appropriate scale for the rural location.. The site remains available. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Land and buildings that from part of the Prudhoe Hospital at the edge of the town. Around half of the overall site is brownfield, the remainder open space. This is a former psychiatric hospital that has continued to be occupied by NHS facilities until recent years. The complex includes the Grade II listed Prudhoe Hall (c.1870), which was originally a private home and a church hall before being converted for hospital use. Site now declared surplus and a proposals for a strategic redevelopment of land and buildings is being progressed. This includes parallel provision of new NHS facilities (T/20090634). An initial outline permission clearance and mixed-use redevelopment was granted in 2009 (T/20081020). This early proposal comprised of a new hospital, specialist care village for the elderly, and residential development. Detailed permission was later approved for demolition of the majority of this site, redevelopment with 392 new-build homes, and then 12 further units created through conversion, was permitted in 2016 (14/04160/FUL). Only a small element of the facility will be retained, the Grade II listed Prudhoe Hall, subject of the conversion. Works also include extensive demolition of non-listed buildings and provision of supporting services, facilities and infrastructure, .Site is a mix of brownfield and greenfield land with the former involving redevelopment of existing buildings. Brownfield element (c.20ha) represents around 55% of the site area - a yield of around 220 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 2494) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 40.01ha. Construction to provide 404 dwellings is now underway., with a long-term build-out programme expected. Delivery to continue over the next 5-years with final completion of the site forecast within the 6-10 year period.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Land in town centre that was previously the site of Hexham bus station. Now vacant following relocation of the facility and identified as a key redevelopment opportunity. Proposals for mixed-use redevelopment have been made on a number of occasions over the years, in part and as part of a wider scheme with adjacent land (2258, 2497). This planning history goes back over a long period. An initial permission for redevelopment of the bus station site, providing retail units and 30 flats, was granted in 1992 (T/92/E/398,T/950511). Despite renewal, this lapsed. A number of years later a revised scheme was submitted for tandem redevelopment of both parcels. A revised application for a complex mixed-use scheme of residential development and retail, commercial and office floorspace was permitted but again lapsed without commencement (15/02794/FUL). A total of 36 dwellings were proposed, comprising of 5 houses and 31 apartments in three blocks. The proposal included part demolition, reconstruction, alteration and conversion of the existing buildings. It has recently been confirmed that a revised scheme is going to be proposed in due course. Currently considered developable later in the plan period. Any future redevelopment is likely to be in combination with adjacent land (2258, 2497). There will be opportunity for a higher density development in this location, probably with an apartment scheme. The potential yield is recorded against the former bus station record (see 2497). An application for extensive and complex redevelopment works, including part demolition, reconstruction, alteration and conversion of a range of buildings to create a mixed-use development, including to create 36 dwellings and commercial floorspace, was permitted in 2015 (15/02794/FUL)..The proposed scheme would deliver floorspace for retail, commercial and office premises, alongside the development of 5 houses and 31 flats across three apartment blocks. The site encompasses two parcels of land (2497, 2258) and encompasses an operating bus station, photography studio, a former ropery, various vacant buildings, as well as areas of vacant land. This permission lapsed due to non-implementation. Another application for demolition of the ropery and construction of 6 dwellings was withdrawn prior to determination (13/03838/FUL). This scheme only encompassed the old ropery building on the eastern parcel (2258), An earlier application for demolition of the existing building and construction of 17 apartments and 2 office units, was permitted in 2006 (T/20061115). This scheme was for the bulk of the eastern parcel, but excluding the old ropery (2258), Similarly, this permission lapsed due to non-implementation. An earlier outline application for part clearance and construction of retail units and 30 flats was permitted in 2005 (T/950511). This was a renewal of an earlier permission, dating from 1992 (T/92/E/398). A revised application for a complex mixed-use scheme of residential development and retail, commercial and office floorspace was permitted but again lapsed without commencement (15/02794/FUL). A total of 36 dwellings were proposed, comprising of 5 houses and 31 apartments in three blocks. The proposal included part demolition, reconstruction, alteration and conversion of the existing buildings. Whilst previous schemes have not progressed, it still considered to be developable in the medium- to longer-term. It has recently been confirmed that a revised scheme is going to be proposed in due course. Any future redevelopment is likely to be in combination with adjacent land (2258, 2497). There will be opportunity for a higher density development in this location, probably with an apartment scheme. The potential yield is recorded against one record (see 2497).</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Site to the west of Hexham town centre comprising of the existing West Orchard House, associated land and adjacent vacant land. The north east of the site had also been occupied by an ambulance station and associated classrooms for training/teaching, but this had been cleared following earlier relocation. The site/building has had a number of other uses, including a funeral directors, garages, and offices for the Red Cross. Largely brownfield site with small element of greenfield land. The overall SHLAA site is mixed but a reduced yield recognises a focus on the brownfield land (0.24ha) . Brownfield element as been considered suitable for small-scale development of 6 units in the past. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 2554) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 0.43ha. A number of proposals for (re)development have been put forward over the years. This includes for the whole site and in part. Two parallel applications, for demolition of the redundant ambulance station and associated classrooms, refurbishment of the main building, and construction of a new office block, were refused (12/00327/CON, 12/00355/FUL). A revised proposal was then permitted (12/03311/CON, 12/03310/FUL). This proposals is for the northern part of the site. Another application for building of a single dwelling on land to the rear has now also been permitted (15/03735/FUL). This is for the southern part of the site. Following recent reappraisal, it is no longer considered that any further potential for residential development now remains. No future residential development is now forecast from the site.</div>

Facility currently in operational use and is not currently available, although it has been suggested in the past that the site may become surplus. Any timescale for this change is dependent on operational and business needs of BT. Likely to be delivered as part of wider scheme comprising the exchange building and associated land (2615, 2616). Previously identified as an allocation in the draft Local Plan (submitted May 2019) and also in the emerging Hexham Neighbourhood Plan. Recently confirmed the site will not be available for redevelopment for the foreseeable future. This position could change in the longer-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.

A number of constraints are identified but if these can be addressed then a residential development could be taken forward, likely to be in the medium-term. Brownfield in part (0.19ha) - indicative yield of around 5 dwellings appropriate for this parcel. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 2628) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 1.10ha. Redevelopment could potentially be progressed a s part of a group of adjacent sites (2040, 2628, 9136). Recently confirmed that redevelopment of the land is being considered and that a residential scheme is likely to be proposed in due course. Currently considered developable later in the plan period. Identified as an allocation in the Reg.19 Local Plan (submitted May 2019) and also in the Hexham Neighbourhood Plan.</div>

The building is now vacant and available for a redevelopment project. Two alternative schemes has recently been approved. The first was for development of 16 flats and 2 cottages, through part demolition, alteration and conversion of the listed building and construction of new-build homes (17/04070/FUL). The second, for 16 units in total, again by part demolition, extension and conversion of the Grade II listed office buildings, construction of a new three-storey apartment block to form 14 flats, and then 2 additional cottages (19/01910/FUL). Works include demolition of the former council chamber and construction of an extension to the rear, followed by construction of a 3-storey apartment block. As a result, at present both permissions are extant and either could be implemented and delivered in due course. Development yet to commence but forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Operating auction mart that comprises extensive buildings, associated facilities and land. The site represents a sizeable area of brownfield land in a rural location. However, given the presence of an operational business, which performs an important role in the local community, the site is not available in the short-term. Relocation is not currently being considered by the owners but potential for redevelopment may exist in the longer-term. Recently confirmed that this will not be before 2029. This could be either in whole or part, depending on future commercial and business requirements. Any residential development would need to be reflective of the wider village and isolated location. In light of this an indicative yield of 30 dwellings is considered fitting. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

Mainly brownfield with a very small greenfield element, including some Grade II listed buildings. Identified for redevelopment for a number of years. Yield indicated is capacity of the brownfield element. An initial outline application for 17 dwellings, through part demolition, conversion an new-build, was disposed of without determination in 2018 (15/04203/OUT). A revised proposal has since been submitted. This is for a total of 30 dwellings, with the application now minded to approve, with only S106 agreement remaining outstanding (18/00168/FUL). The works involve demolition of an existing bungalow, part demolition of agricultural bluing's, conversion of the remaining listed farm buildings to create 2 units and construction of 26 new-build homes and 4 affordable bungalows. The scheme also includes the refurbishment of a flat above former shop/cafe (not net gain from this aspect). If permitted, the proposal will result in the net gain of 27 dwellings on completion. Final permission is yet to be granted but completion is forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

The building is now surplus, vacant and offers opportunity for redevelopment through conversion. A relatively high density is considered to be appropriate, recognising the location within central Morpeth and likelihood of a conversion to flats. An initial application for 17 dwellings, provided through a combination of conversation and new-build development, was refused and dismissed on appeal (17/00884/FUL.). After this, two alternative schemes have recently been permitted. The first is for alteration and conversion of the listed building to 13 flats, alongside construction of 4 new dwellings on land to the rear. A revised scheme, just focussed on conversion, this time to create 12 apartments, has since followed (19/00692/FUL). This supersedes a number of other planning permissions secured in earlier years. This includes a scheme for conversion of the listed building to 13 flats, demolition of outbuildings and construction of 4 new dwellings (18/00336/FUL). Both permissions currently remain extant, either of which could be delivered. Depending on which scheme is progressed either 12 or 17 units could be delivered on completion. Development is yet to start but, whichever scheme is progress is expected to be finished within the next 5 years.</div>

The remainder of the site consists of open space. Despite a somewhat peripheral location outside of a defined settlement, it offers opportunity for redevelopment of a substantive site, partly brownfield in nature. Demolition of the redundant buildings is required. Permission in place for clearance and erection of 89 dwellings (16/02336/FUL). Site is a mix of brownfield and greenfield land. Brownfield parcel (3.12ha) represents around 30% of the site area but the new development is limited to the footprint of the former buildings. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 3034) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 10.93ha. Development has now commenced and completion is forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

Any partial redevelopment of the site would need to carefully consider the needs of operational employment land to the north and the relationship to adjacent housing. An outline application for demolition and redevelopment for 65 homes was withdrawn in 2018 (17/01887/OUT). This proposal was not progressed but encompassed the two vacant adjacent parcels of land, part of the wider industrial estate (3052, 3053). Recently confirmed that the site is available and a revised residential scheme will be proposed in due course. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

This proposal was for a scheme made up of 15 flats and 5 houses. Given the operational use and business on the site, any redevelopment is likely to be in the longer-term. A lower yield that that proposed through the earlier proposal would be more suitable, with 5 dwellings considered fitting given the location and adjacent established residential development.

The former industrial buildings and gasholders were cleared at an earlier date and there is an opportunity for infill redevelopment.

The land has been utilised for storage recently, enabled by an approval for change of use (16/00598/FUL). The current availability of the site is uncertain.

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Strategic former hospital site comprising of a range of buildings and a large area of associated land. The facility is now vacant, surplus to requirements and available for redevelopment. This follows the completion of the new St. George's Hospital facility. Identified for a strategic mixed-use redevelopment. Demolition of the remaining 12 buildings was initially undertaken (15/01620/DEMGDO). A hybrid permission (full and outline) was then secured for 875 homes, alongside a wide range of supporting uses (16/00994/FULES). As well as residential development, the scheme includes a local centre to potentially provide a range of retail, food and drink, community, leisure and businesses uses, alongside associated open space and strategic infrastructure. A further outline application for 50 dwellings is also currently pending (18/03650/OUT). Site is a mix of brownfield and greenfield land with the former involving redevelopment of existing buildings. Brownfield element (c.20ha) represents around one-third of the site area - a yield of around 282 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 3074) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 64.51ha. The site is now under-construction. It is forecast that delivery will continue over the next 5 years and beyond, with a long-term build-out programme envisaged over 20+ years.</div>

The site has not been utilised as a garage for a number of years, but the associated former shop has more latterly been utilised as 2 retail units, including as a post office, with 2 flats at first floor level. However, retails use has now ceased and the flat-roofed building has been in a poor state of repair. The post office has moved to another shop immediately adjacent (3049). The former garage forecourt is now occupied by a car wash business and is therefore not available in the immediate term. Permission was granted for redevelopment of the site with 6 flats some years ago, but wat never implemented and lapsed (CM/20090251). This would have seen the demolition of the existing building, clearance and a new-build block of 6 apartments constructed. An existing business remains operating from the site and there has been no recent indication of relocation and/or change in circumstances. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

Significant remediation likely to due to former use. An outline application for up to 200 homes was live for a number of years but was eventually disposed of in 2019 (CM/20090157). This proposal was for a mixed-use scheme and included employment and community uses alongside residential development across two sites (3101. 3496). Identified yield reflecting a confined to development on brownfield land. Despite the previous proposal not coming to fruition, the land is considered to still have potential to support a residential scheme, although this will need to be at scale appropriate Part of the site is proposed for designation as priority open space and outwith the identified settlement boundary in the Local Plan.

The site was vacant for a time but is now occupied by a tyre business. There is also an associated two-storey dwelling on the site. During the period the site was unused, it was identified for redevelopment. Works would require demolition of the existing garage and remediation. Identified yield could be towards the lower range of what is appropriate given the location. A previous proposal for demolition of the garage premises and construction of 10 dwellings was submitted but later withdrawn (15/04227/FUL). An existing business remains operating from the site and there has been no recent indication of relocation and/or change in circumstances. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

The facility had originally been built in 1910 and operating for many years until closure in 1996. On becoming surplus to NHS requirements it then stood vacant and unused for a number of years afterwards. A scheme would involve demotion of redundant buildings prior to redevelopment. providing a mixed use scheme. An initial outline permission for residential, commercial and employment development was permitted in 2007 (CM/20060893). The partial clearance of redundant buildings was an aspect of the works. Detailed permission for 172 dwellings, through a combination and conversion and new-build was then approved (CM/20080874). Subsequently a number of further applications have been permitted for additional residential development and the clearance of former hospital buildings, increasing the overall yield to 270 dwellings (11/02980/FUL, 14/03197/FUL, 15/03676/FUL, 16/00221/FUL). The employment and commercial development from the initial outline have been subject to separate detailed applications. Brownfield element (c.10ha) represents around two-thirds of the overall development area - a yield of around 178 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 3318x) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 56.23ha. Alongside the residential development, the scheme also includes a wide variety of supporting infrastructure, services and facilities. Development has now commenced and completion is forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

The southern part of the site is now largely vacant and overgrown following earlier clearance. The northern part of the site comprises of hardstanding, utilised for vehicle storage for the adjacent industrial land. This immediate adjacent land was previously part of the Linton Colliery site until closure. Any remaining structures would require clearance. Identified for redevelopment for a number of years, with outline permission for residential development first granted in 2003 (03/D/0614). A detailed scheme was then consented for 5 detached dwellings but this permission lapsed, despite renewal (CM/200610322, 10/S/00036/VARYCO,). Despite the earlier proposal not being progressed, it is still considered that potential for redevelopment still exists. The identified yield reflects adjacent residential development. The immediate availability of the site is uncertain. It is considered to still have potential in the longer-term, but residential development is forecast later in the plan period.</div>

Available for redevelopment following relocation of the business to new site. Demolition of the vacant premises and clearance of the site has already ben undertaken. The site has been identified for redevelopment for a long time, with proposals for redevelopment of the site for a care home date back to the 1980s. Subsequently, a number of applications for mixed-use redevelopment were permitted, which included commercial development alongside the residential units, but were not progressed (CM/05/D/879, CM/20061085, 12/00042/FUL). A revised scheme was more recently permitted for construction of 55 retirement units then approved (15/02224/FUL). The proposal was an apartment block comprising of self-contained flats for over-60s, along with an office for the house manager, communal facilities such as a residentsÃ­ lounge, a guest suite and gardens. Development of 55 dwellings completed in 2018/19.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Disused factory site to the west of Widdrington Station, and not within the main settlement. The complex comprises of flat-roofed buildings, largely single storey, but are now derelict and in an increasing state of disrepair. The land had previously been part of Stobswood drift mine, housing the pithead baths, lamp room and associated outbuildings. On closure, an industrial workshop was constructed, which was utilised for furniture manufacturing for many years. The site has been vacant for some time and is no longer considered suitable for modern industrial/commercial use. A range of buildings are currently in situ and would require clearance prior to redevelopment. An initial outline application was refused in 2006 (CM/20060524). A revised proposal, for demolition and development of 13 homes, theoretically remains to be determined (CM/20070970). However there has been no progress with this application for many years. A much more recent proposal to build 9 homes on clearance was then submitted but later withdrawn (17/00204/FUL). Recently confirmed that the landowner still intends to redevelop the site and progress the live planning application. Noting the long planning history, it remains available. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Former psychiatric hospital site to the norther edge of Morpeth, comprising of a range of buildings and extensive areas of green land. The hospital was closed in 1995 and is now surplus to NHS requirements and available for redevelopment. This follows the completion of the new St. George's Hospital facility. Identified for a strategic mixed-use redevelopment. Occupied by the main two-storey former hospital building and wings provided through extension of the facility over the years. There are also a number of additional buildings in situ, including a former Chapel, terraced and single two-storey residential properties, larger administration buildings, and a range of outbuildings. All of these are vacant, are identified for clearance, and require demolition. A hybrid application for 375 dwellings, alongside supporting facilities, was initial approved (14/02750/FUL). This included full permission for demolition of existing hospital buildings and construction of 119 dwellings and outline planning permission for further demolition and the phased redevelopment of site for up to 256 homes along with community, leisure uses and public open space. Two applications for further development (phase-1b and phase-1c) are currently pending. The first is a hybrid application for the construction of 159 dwellings (19/00904/FUL). As week as an outline application for an extra-care/community well-being facility with up to 80 accommodation units (19/00903/OUT). For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 3397) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 19.8ha. Development is well underway and completion is forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Former Northumbria Police HQ to the northern edge of Ponteland, that was declared surplus following relocation to a new site in central Newcastle. First developed in 1902 to provide cottage homes for children, the original buildings are Grade II listed. The existing it then became a teacher training college in 1962 and saw extensive development following this.. Many of the buildings were constructed in the 1960s and are of low-quality, many being in a poor state of repair. The Police Authority took occupation of the site in 1982 but it is not longer required for operational purposes and available for redevelopment. There a large number of existing buildings on site, providing office and administrative accommodation, and training facilities, the vast majority of which require demolition. The exceptions will be the retention of the existing communications centre, which is to remain in police use, and the listed buildings at the centre of the site. The latter are identified on a separate parcel (3427a). Redevelopment has been proposed for many years. The original proposal for redevelopment was withdrawn (CM/20080775).A revised scheme for mixed-use redevelopment was then approved in outline (14/01442/OUT). Detailed permission for 253 new homes has recently followed (17/02747/REM). The vast majority of the site is brownfield in nature - although there is a very small element of greenfield land the yield represents the capacity of the brownfield land. Comprehensive development of the site is now underway. Delivery forecast to continue of the next 5 years with final completion forecast within the 6-10 year period.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Land at the former Stobswood Colliery and associated brickworks. The site has been cleared in recent times following cessation of the industrial uses, with all the previous buildings and associated infrastructure gradually having been cleared as the site has declined. This culminated with clearance of the brickworks in 2005 following final closure, Now fully vacant, comprising of the footprint of former buildings and hardstanding, much of which is overgrown. Demolition waste still occupies the site following the clearance and significant remediation is still required prior to redevelopment. Somewhat peripheral location, being located to the far side of the ECML to the rest of Stobswood and Widdrington Station, although offers a chance for a comprehensive redevelopment of derelict industrial land. Significant remediation is required before development can begin. Provision of a residential scheme has been proposed for a number of years and there is a complex planning history to the site. The original proposal for 36 units was refused (05/D/773). A revised outline permission for 26 homes was permitted but not progressed (CM/20061042). Following this, a hybrid consent was secured for 149 homes, the majority of which were in outline (CM/20090001). It included full planning permission for a small-scale scheme of 19 dwellings, a phase-1 to development. Initial site works have implemented this permission and it will not lapse. An application to vary this was approved in 2020, reducing the overall total to 104 homes (17/04653/VARYCO). However, in a recent Section 73 application, the applicant proposes to expand the phase-1 area to encompass 50 dwellings rather than the 19 previously indicated. So it is yet to be confirmed how many dwellings will be constructed and what elements of the permission will be delivered due to the complex nature of the planning history.. The permitted scheme includes a combined heat and power plant, enterprise space, allotments and associated open space. It is noted that a number of obstacles and constraints are evident, factors that have led to viability/deliverable to be questioned in the past. However, the hybrid permission remains extant, with it recently confirmed the landowner is continue to make progress towards delivering a residential scheme. Delivery forecast to begin within the next 5 years, with overall completion forecast for the 6-10 year period.</div>

Since then, the site has comprised of hardstanding, with an element of demolition waste remaining, but the vast majority being overgrown and neglected. Significant remediation works are necessary as part of a redevelopment scheme. An initial hybrid application for mixed-use development was secured (14/03016/FUL). In addition to the residential development, it includes retail, employment and commercial floorspace. A total of 400 dwellings are due to be built-out in a long-term delivery plan, with four phases expected in due course. A detailed permission for phase-1 of 99 homes has now been approved (19/00389/REM). This initial element is now underway. Further detailed applications for later phases will be made in due course.

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Former local authority residential care institution and associated land that is now surplus to requirements. Relatively peripheral setting, lying outside a settlement. The site formed Netherton Park Secure ChildrenÃ­s Home, consisting buildings and associated areas of hardstanding and land. The facilities were housed in one main building and then a number of smaller properties. Following review, in 2012 the site was declared surplus to requirements and available for redevelopment. This was part of wider proposal to relocate to smaller community homes in local areas, rather than operate a centralised facility at this location. The care units and administrative buildings were gradually vacated following this decision. A redevelopment scheme will involve demolition of the empty buildings, some of which are in a poor state of repair. Outline planning permission is in place for redevelopment for up to 85 units (14/00808/OUT).. A reserved matters application has now been submitted and is pending (20/02069/REM). Site is mixed in nature, with the brownfield element (3.28ha) representing almost half of the site area - a yield of around 36 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 3500) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 7.89ha. Development yet to commence but is forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Vacant land that was occupied by a gymnasium, public house and associated flat, all of which were demolished some time ago. The site has been identified for redevelopment for a number of years and there is a complex planning history evident. An initial application for demolition of the gym and bar and construction of 3 dwellings was permitted in 2009 but the scheme was not progressed (CM/20090458). However, the vacant buildings were demolished following this approval. Another proposal for 6 homes was then approved in 2014 (14/00631/FUL). This permission has been partly delivered with 2 bungalows completed. Subsequently, an application for constructing of 3 homes was permitted in 2018 (18/02142/FUL). This is a revised proposal relating to the remainder of the site, amending the initial scheme by replacing 4 bungalows with 2 houses and a bungalow. The initial permission and has been implemented and remains live but the later scheme will also have permission until expiry in 2021. Therefore, either 3 or 4 homes can be built on the rest of the site in due course, depending on which proposal is progressed. As a result of the extant permissions, either 5 or 6 dwellings could eventually be delivered on completion. However, given the complex nature of this revised permission, it is considered a separate proposal. Now classified as a small site in the SHLAA.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Mixed site at that was historically occupied by a farmstead but is now disused, comprising of vacant buildings and hardstanding and a small element of greenfield land. The remnants of the original use will require clearance prior to redevelopment. This parcel has now been identified for redevelopment as part of a much larger proposal, across a large area of land at Bebside (4564, 4726, 9089). An outline application for a large mixed-use development, including construction of 327 dwellings and commercial floorspace, is currently pending consideration (19/00428/OUT). This significant scheme is described as a 'Lifetime Neighbourhood', with the supporting commercial development being in the form of retail units. This particular parcel only forms a very small proportion of the overall scheme. The yield identified in the SHLAA reflects focus on the brownfield aspect (0.10ha). For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 4564) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 0.55 ha. The current proposal indicates the site is available for development. If the current application is permitted, the deliverability of development will be reappraised.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Former Bates Colliery site that has been largely vacant for many years following the closure of the pit 1986. All the former colliery buildings have been cleared with only a few remnants of industrial infrastructure remain across the wider site. This offers a significant redevelopment opportunity to the north of Blyth town centre. The land requires extensive remediation due to the former use. The original outline permission for 327 homes across the whole site was granted in 2009 (08/00169/OUT). A detailed permission for 257 homes then followed (12/03370/REM). The remediation works have been carried out following this. A revised application was then approved for phase-1 of the development (16/04622/FUL). This involves development of 142 two-, three- and four-bed semi and detached dwellings, on a smaller element of the site (4573a). Development has now commenced and completion is forecast within the next 5 years. It is understood that remaining element of the site will not be progressed as the eastern parcel has been sold to the Port of Blyth. This is identified on a separate record, but is now not available for residential development (4573b). Another part of the original site has now been developed for a new school (4573c). As a result, the indicative balance of 115 dwellings from the original permission for 257 homes is now discounted in the SHLAA..</div>

Construction of a residential scheme was then started, despite detailed permission not having been approved. A retrospective reserved matters application for construction of 5 dwellings was finally permitted in 2019 (19/01893/REM). This was necessary, despite the scheme being underway. Completion is forecast with the next 5 years. The overall development is for 8 homes, with three other dwellings permitted on a plot-by-plot basis (plots 1, 7 & 8).

These buildings had been demolished at an earlier date after becoming surplus. Within an established residential area. An initial outline application for residential development was submitted in 2004 (B/04/00644/OUT). The S106 was never signed for this. Despite this, a reserved matters application for 48 homes were then allowed on appeal in 2007 (B/06/00225/FUL). This scheme comprised of 33 flats, 9 terraced houses, 4 detached houses and 2 bungalows. Although later extended, this permission lapsed (10/S/00290/VARYCO). Redevelopment remains an opportunity for urban infill,. The high density identified considered to reflect the setting and likely proposals for an apartment/flatted scheme. The immediate availability of the site is uncertain. It is considered to still have potential in the longer-term, but residential development is forecast later in the plan period.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Area of land at the edge of the settlement that is part occupied by derelict outbuildings and the remainder being a paddock. The site was previously occupied by a residential property, but this had been cleared at an earlier date.. It has been subject to numerous redevelopment proposals over the years, for a range of uses. A permission for 15 new build dwellings and a pub/hotel, lapsed without progress (09/S/00330/OUT). Another hybrid application for a variety of uses, including a 30-bed hotel (C1), was submitted but later withdrawn (18/04255/FUL). The latest permission is for a mixed-use scheme, with scope for retail, food and drink, leisure and business floorspace (19/04140/FUL) This does not include any residential development. Although the SHLAA site is mixed, the reduced yield indicated recognises a focus on the brownfield aspect (0.51ha). For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 4669) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 1.36ha. Earlier proposals for redevelopment were not delivered. The latest permission does not include any housing development but there may be potential remaining on land not covered by the current permission, with availability recently confirmed by the landowner. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

Predominantly hardstanding and grassed areas remain. Offers a good opportunity for redevelopment in the urban area, with scope to provide a residential scheme in an attractive waterfront location. A planning permission was previously consented for scheme of 49 two- three- and four-bed dwellings but this has now lapsed (15/01941/FUL). This was for part of this wider area of land (4736a), Adjacent land remains occupied and utilised for industrial/commercial purposes and is neither suitable or available for residential development (4736b, 4736c). The immediate availability of the site is uncertain. It is considered to still have potential in the longer-term, but residential development is forecast later in the plan period.</div>

This has been identified for redevelopment in the past and there may be opportunity for intensification through redevelopment. Likely to be through a combination of conversion, extension and remodelling of the building and additional new-build construction. A number of applications to this effect have been permitted, and renewed, but all have lapsed without work starting (B/07/00447/FUL, 11/01565/FUL, 16/00880/FUL). Each scheme is essential the same. The latest approval was for works included alteration to the building to create 4 additional flats and demolition of a domestic garage with replacement by 1 new dwelling. The existing apartment block currently contains 8 flats, the proposed works resulting in 13 units on the site (5 net additions). It has recently been confirmed that the remains available but it is now understood that it would have to be sold prior to scheme progressing. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

Opportunity for redevelopment, potentially through conversion of the existing buildings an/or new-build. There is a long planning history to the site and it has been highlighted to provide a residential scheme for some years. An outline permission was originally granted in 1999 for conversion of the farm buildings to 7 homes and construction of 1 further dwelling, but lapsed (B/99/C/0195/P). A revised outline planning permission for up to 9 homes, also through of conversion and new-build aspects, was later granted but again lapsed without implementation (07/00533/OUT). More recently identified as an allocated housing site in the Cramlington Neighbourhood Plan ('made'). Relatively low density identified recognises constraints. The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

This building was previously proposed for significant alterations to provide residential units alongside the existing commercial floorspace. Consent was previously secured for 6 maisonettes above retail units but scheme was not progressed and lapsed (07/00539/FUL). The proposed extension works were to be an enormous undertaking. The project was to involve alteration of the single-storey flat-roofed building with construction of two floors of apartments, with the retail floorspace being reconfigured at ground-floor level. This permission was never implemented and it is highly unlikely a similar proposal would be revisited. There may still be scope for residential use, but this is likely to be through clearance and redevelopment. Relatively high density reflective of setting and likely nature of an appropriate scheme. The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

This includes the Grade II listed Damdykes Farmhouse and outbuildings, additional outbuildings further to the north with the remainder a paddock/grazing land. grassland to the west. The existing buildings were occupied until 2005 but have since deteriorated significantly, with much of the dressed stone and original roofs having been removed. This has rapidly accelerating the structural decay of the listed buildings. The farmstead has been identified for redevelopment for a number of years. An initial application for conversion of the listed agricultural buildings to create 5 dwellings was permitted in 2007 (B/07/00143/RES). However, given the deterioration, it was not considered viable to restore the majority of the listed buildings and this consent lapsed. A revised proposal was put forward, as reappraisal meant new-build development was seen as necessary to support any restoration. Permission was later secured for a total of 20 dwellings, 19 new-build dwellings and a further unit through conversion and restoration of the Grade II listed farmhouse (11/01273/FUL). Development has commenced with completion forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

The site is part occupied by a dilapidated two-storey building forming part of the main terrace, with a shop on the ground-floor and storage space above. The rest of the site consists of vacant brownfield land. Opportunity for redevelopment for residential use may existing, potentially through conversion and/or new-build development. In the latter scenario, demolition of the existing building is likely to be required. A number of years ago, permission was granted for demolition and construction of a new building comprising of retail and residential floorspace, how this lapsed without implementation (B/08/00054/FUL). The new building was to consist of 3 ground-floor retail units with 6 flats above. A subsequent extension of time limit was refused and the appeal dismissed (11/00064/VARYCO). The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

Potential for redevelopment has been highlighted in the past. This would require demolition and remediation of the site prior to a scheme progressing. Outline permission was granted for demolition of petrol station and redevelopment of site for 12 apartments, but this lapsed due to non-commencement, despite renewal (06/00393/OUT, 10/S/00536/VARYCO). At the time of this application, the site was unused and vacant. Since then a garage business has been occupying the site for a number of years. A retrospective application for temporary use for car sales and maintenance was permitted and then renewed more recently (10/S/00531/COU, 16/04392/COU). An existing business remains operating from the site and there has been no recent indication of relocation and/or change in circumstances. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

The main building was originally a chapel, which had latterly been converted to a garage for vehicle maintenance and servicing. Relatively high yield representative of location and previous proposals for an apartment scheme that would be in keeping with setting. An earlier application for clearance and construction of 10 apartments was approved but lapsed (07/00250/FUL). A subsequent application to extend time limit was submitted but then withdrawn (10/S/00570/VARYCO). Therefore the original permission lapsed. The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

The parcel is currently occupied by a workshop and associated vacant land, an a existing terraced house and retail unit. Redevelopment could be pursued through a combination part demolition, new-build and/or conversion. Higher yield recognises potential for scheme of higher density urban infill. A previous permission involved provision of 8 flats and 2 houses following clearance of the workshop, but lapsed (08/00113/FUL) The site has now been sold but it has recently been confirmed by the new landowner that it remains available and that options for redevelopment are being explored. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

The school buildings have already been demolished and the site cleared in readiness for redevelopment, enabled by an earlier approval (13/01267/DEMGDO). Mainly brownfield but wider site includes former playing fields. An application for development of 66 homes is now pending consideration (16/03954/FUL). Brownfield land (0.61ha) represents around 25% of the site area - a yield of around 16 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 5059) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 2.39ha. If the current application is permitted, the deliverability of development will be reappraised. Identified as an allocation in the Reg.19 Local Plan (submitted May 2019).</div>

Redevelopment to provide a mixed-use scheme has been proposed. An original outline consent was approved for a wide range of uses including retail, commercial, business, and leisure as well as up to 12 dwellings (17/00444/OUT). Two detailed permissions have now been granted for development, comprising phase-a and phase-b (19/04899/REM, 18/01658/REM). The residential element is included in phase-b, but the proposal has been reduced to 4 apartments (18/01658/REM).

However, the wider site remains occupied by an electrical business, with recent proposals for renewal and improvement of industrial buildings having seen permitted, indicating investment in the site (see 5172). An existing business remains operating from the site and there has been no recent indication of relocation and/or change in circumstances.

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Area of vacant land that comprises part of a large of cleared industrial land. Offers opportunity for extensive redevelopment. Formerly the site of Cambois Colliery, occupied by the pit and associated railway land, terraced houses and allotment gardens. The site could potentially be part of wider scheme of redevelopment at Cambois, including other sites identified in the SHLAA. Significant constraints to development are recognised, notably locational factors and need for significant remediation . An initial outline application for comprehensive mixed-use redevelopment of a wider site (5047, 5048, 5098, 5103) was submitted in 2008 (08/00403/OUTES) This proposal was for remediation of former industrial land followed by construction of 467 homes along with retail and health facilities, care home, combined heat and power facility, roads, car parking and landscaping. The live proposal was amended 2011, now being for remediation and construction of 323 houses and the supporting commercial, leisure and community facilities. This application remains minded to approve, subject to agreement of the S106 and a number of other issues. Whilst it has been outstanding for a number of years, work continues to progress and, if approved, the applicant intents to deliver this significant regeneration scheme during the plan period. Not currently considered deliverable, but development is forecast for the medium- to longer-term.</div>

Prior to this it had functioned as a lorry park and had originally been part of wider industrial land. Mainly brownfield with this element of the site able to support development above the threshold. Brownfield parcel (0.16ha) represents around 50% of the site area - yield of around 6 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 5116) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 0.30ha. Yield identified reflects appropriate density given location. Permission was granted for construction of a unit supporting business/office floorspace, but the scheme was never delivered (03/00126/FUL). The current availability of the site is uncertain.

Demolition required in order to progress with an infill residential scheme. The site has a long planning history, being subject to a number of proposals after first being identified for redevelopment . An application for development of 19 homes was originally submitted in 2003 ((03/00442/FUL). This took a number of years to determined, was refused in 2008, before being allowed on appeal in 2009. Involved redevelopment of land within settlement following the demolition of the disused church hall. This permission was implemented and, despite no progress for many years, it remained live. However, revised proposals were put forward for the redevelopment of the site after a start was made. A proposal for 12 dwellings was refused in 2009 (09/00003/FUL). Another application for 13 dwellings, through a combination of conversion and new-build homes, was also refused in 2009 (08/00133/FUL). appeals were lodged against both decisions but each was dismissed. After a number of years without progress, a new developer took on the site and return to the original scheme, as the permission had remained live since 2009. It was ultimately this scheme that was delivered. Development of 19 dwellings completed in 2018/19.</div>

Following closure of Ashington Colliery in 1986, the site continued to be utilised as employment land and became a haulage depot for Fergusons. Following relocation of the business to new premises, this site was vacant and available for alternative use Demolition of the former workshop buildings and remediation of the site required prior to redevelopment. An application was allowed on appeal in 2003 for clearance of the site and construction of 357 new homes (00/00213/FUL). The application had originally been refused in 2001. Subsequently application to amend the initial scheme have been permitted since, increasing the final yield to 367 homes. The site has been slowly delivered over recent years and works are now reaching conclusion. Completion is forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

A range of buildings and outbuildings, for both teaching and supporting facilities, are on site. The site has been highlighted for redevelopment in the past but there has been recent investment in the site to indicate that this not a short-term plan. This may change if a decision was made to relocate the education facility. The adjacent open space would not be suitable for residential development. Mixed site of both brownfield and greenfield land. Brownfield parcel (3.85ha) represents 50% of the site area but lower yield is reflective of development focusing on the footprint of the existing buildings. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 5147) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 7.63ha. A number of years ago, an outline application for demolition of the existing college buildings and associated facilities and construction of 250 dwellings was permitted (05/00160/OUT). This lapsed without commencement. This was part of a wider project to relocate the campus to an alternative site. Since then, this plan has been reappraised, and permissions have been granted for improved and extended educational facilities (13/01934/FUL, 16/00307/FUL). Only an element of the site is likely to be available and only the brownfield element would be suitable. The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

In the past it has been indicated that the site could potentially be available for redevelopment, probably in tandem with the adjacent land within the same ownership that provides car parking (5094). The indicative yield highlighted for a residential scheme recognises the potential for development at slightly higher density in keeping with the location. However, there has been no recent indication of a plan to relocate and the most recent proposals are for continued use of the site for current use through construction of new industrial buildings (18/04464/FUL). This confirms that the land is not currently available for redevelopment. An existing business remains operating from the site and there has been no recent indication of relocation and/or change in circumstances.

Higher density of development indicated recognises the location and the nature of likely flat/apartment development. Consent previously granted for construction of 6 flats but this lapsed (08/00326/FUL). The use of the site as a garage was enabled by subsequent permission (11/01433/FUL). This also permitted temporary siting of a residential caravan. A more recent proposal to extend the garage facilities was refused (15/03760/FUL). The current availability of the site is uncertain.

This work was not undertaken but each element was included within a more significant proposal including the adjacent land to the rear. This permission was for selected demolition, construction of 41 units, and provision of 7 apartments through part demolition, conversion and change of use on this parcel (09/00040/OUT). However, this lapsed without a start. despite this, an indicative capacity of 5 units is still considered appropriate for this smaller parcel of land. A number of earlier permissions for conversion of the exist buildings were permitted in earlier years. The current availability of the site is uncertain.

The site was previously been occupied by The Officers Club but had become disused after the business closed. Identified for redevelopment for a mixed-use scheme, with the vacant industrial buildings requiring demolition and clearance. An initial outline application for demolition of the existing factory and construction of 225 dwellings was refused in 2006 (05/00188/OUT). A revised outline permission for mixed-use development was then allowed on appeal (11/02409/OUT). This initial proposal was for two elements, a residential phase of 120 homes and an employment phase providing commercial and industrial floorspace. A reserved matter application for 118 homes followed (14/02894/REM). Development of 118 dwellings completed in 2017/18.</div>

The site was formerly utilised as a builders yard and is also occupied by an existing stone dwelling. Offers potential opportunity for an infill scheme after clearance. A previous permission for demolition of the buildings and redevelopment providing 5 new homes (4 net) was secured some time ago (12/00966/FUL). This lapsed without implementation. The site has become increasingly derelict since then and had deteriorated to the point of being dangerous structures. An application demolition of the buildings was refused however (15/02021/FUL). It has recently been confirmed that the site has been sold and that the new owner intends to pursue a smaller development in due course, for a maximum of 4 homes. As a result of the lower yield it is now classified as a small site in the SHLAA.</div>

Another permission was secured for works including renovation and conversion of existing vacant building to create 3 units, along with alteration to the main house (14/00647/FUL). Both applications have been implemented and therefore either scheme could be delivered. It is now understood that only 3 new homes will be created.

Has previously been identified for redevelopment, offering a chance for an infill scheme in the village. Relatively low yield identified is fitting for site setting and in the wider context of the village. This would require demolition and any necessary remediation prior to progressing. This will be dependent on the business needs of the coach company, including securing an alternative site for relocation. No recent indication that this is being considered. A permission for clearance and construction of 5 homes was secured a number of years ago (CM/20100728). This lapsed, but a revised scheme, also for 5 units was later permitted (14/00945/FUL). Again this lapsed due to non-implementation. The immediate availability of the site is uncertain. It is considered to still have potential in the longer-term, but residential development is forecast later in the plan period.</div>

High density of development would be fitting to reflect conversion scheme in the heart of the town centre. Scheme for conversion to 5 create flats was consented but permission has lapsed (12/00255/FUL). This was for alteration of part of the ground floor and the two upper floors to create residential units. The current availability of the site is uncertain.

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Vacant Grade II listed buildings in Alnwick town centre location. The main building has stood vacant for some time, last being utilised as offices by HMRC. Offers opportunity for sensitive conversion of the main listed building, including demolition of modern extensions. Could potentially be supplemented by new-build development following clearance of other non-listed buildings and outbuildings that remain in situ. An application for conversion and alteration of the main listed building to residential use was permitted in 2015 (15/00835/COU). This lapsed due to non-implementation. Recently confirmed that the landowner is still looking to progress redevelopment of the site and is currently working towards a revised proposal. Considered that 16 to 23 homes would be optimum number of dwellings, utilising some of existing buildings and following demolition of the prefabs. However, the identified yield is considered more fitting for the location and in the context of the listed building. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Land part of wider quarry site, comprising of a mix of buildings, hardstanding, vacant areas and greenfield land. Location is somewhat peripheral. The north east part of the site and land immediately north of the site boundary is occupied by Cast Stone North (previously NASCO), who have traded from the site for over 40 years. Land identified for redevelopment as part of a wider proposal to provide new production facilities for the company. A large shed was in situ on part of the site, however the majority of the production buildings were destroyed by fire in May 2010 and the business now utilises existing smaller buildings that limit manufacturing capabilities. This proposal would allow relocation to a new purpose built plant in a more appropriate industrial area. The remainder of the site is rough grassland used for grazing horses. An initial outline permission for a static caravan/chalet park, together with supporting facilities, was never progressed (10/S/00573/OUT). A revised consent was later secured for development of 63 dwellings was granted in 2016 (16/00592/OUT). As well s residential development this permission included provision for 16 luxury units for short-term holiday accommodation (C2). A reserved matters application is now pending consideration for the details of the scheme (19/04808/REM). The brownfield land (0.47ha) represents a proportion of the overall site area - a yield of around 8 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 6779) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 3.78ha. Lack of recent progress meant the site was not considered deliverable, with completion forecast for the longer-term. However a reserved matters application has recently been submitted. If the current application is permitted, the deliverability of development will be reappraised.</div>

The land had previously provided recreation and sporting facilities for the welfare, notably tennis courts and a cricket ground. These has been disused for a number of years and any remaining derelict buildings have already been cleared. An initial outline consent was approved in 2014 (14/03221/OUT). A reserved matters permission is now in place for 10 dwellings (17/03151/REM). It has been indicated that the dwellings will be completed on a plot-by-plot basis as self-build development. Site is mixed in nature, with brownfield element (0.17ha) representing around half of the site area but lower yield is reflective of development focusing on the footprint of the former welfare building. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 6813) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 1.80ha. The scheme is to be for self-build homes, and the units will be completed on a plot-by-plot basis. Development now under-construction and forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

This particular parcel relates to vacant brownfield land, previously occupied by terraced dwellings, although these had been cleared in earlier years. Location to the edge of Prudhoe is somewhat peripheral. Now earmarked for a phased redevelopment for residential use. An initial outline approval for 50 homes was consented (15/03750/OUT). Reserved matters has very recently followed, being permitted in 2020 for a scheme of 48 homes (19/03517/REM). It is understood that this is intended as a phase-1 to a larger development. The extant permission is on brownfield land (1.62ha) which represents around one-third of the wider site. There may be potential for further delivery as an additional phase of development are being considered for the future. Development is yet to commence but it is forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

There are a small number of buildings which require clearance, but the majority of the site is hardstanding providing open-air storage and development land. After closure of the pit, it was utilised for light industrial and storage purposes before being occupied by a caravan business. However, it has not been identified for redevelopment. Planning permission is now in place for 35 homes across the overall site (14/02140/FUL). The site is a mix of brownfield and greenfield land. The brownfield land (0.45ha) represents a small proportion of the total site area - a yield of around 7 dwellings can be calculated based on the methodological approach.

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Former church hall within a established residential area of Morpeth. The building has been in a state of disrepair, to the point of latterly becoming disused. No longer fit for purpose, the cost of refurbishment are prohibited, so the facility has been identified as surplus to requirements of the Church. Would be available for redevelopment following demolition, although this is likely to require provision of replacement space on a new site to enable this. Initial outline permission for 3 dwellings on clearance was approved in 2014 (14/00136/OUT). This was followed by a detailed permission for a revised scheme of 5 new-build homes (16/00145/REM). This scheme was part of a wider proposal for consolidation. Extensive and costly work would have been required to make the necessary improvements to the existing hall and new facilities have now been provided at nearby St AidenÃ­s Church site in replacement, subject of a separate but related permission (14/00134/FUL). Development of 5 dwellings completed in 2018/19.</div>

Comprises of occupied retail units at ground-floor level with largely vacant storage space above. Indicative yield and density reflects potential to utilise the upper floors of existing building for flats. Previously identified as offering potential for conversion. Permission for a comprehensive and complex redevelopment to provide 9 flats was permitted in 2011 (11/03042/FUL). The residential aspect would be delivered by works to convert and refurbish the first and second floor space to flats. This proposal was not progressed and permission has since lapsed The lapsed permission included consent for extension to thee retail unit at ground floor level. The immediate availability of the site is uncertain. It is considered to still have potential in the longer-term, but residential development is forecast later in the plan period.</div>

Lower indicative yield reflects a range of constraints to the development of the sit Identified as having potential for redevelopment but, due to the current use of the site, it would not be immediately available. Crucially, this is dependent on an alternative site being secured locally to enable relocation of the holiday park. It has recently been confirmed that this option is currently being considered by the landowner and that a proposal will be worked up in due course.

The site became vacant and declared surplus by the Council as it was no longer required. Opportunity existing for conversion to provide residential units, mindful of the listed building designation. Complex scheme for alteration and conversion of the main Hall, former bedroom block, court suite and the former business centre to create a mix of apartments and homes permitted (14/02116/FUL). Further permission granted to amend the initial scheme, changing the number and type of residential units (16/02289/NONMAT, 17/04184/FUL, 17/01618/FUL). The result of these subsequent permissions is that the overall scheme is now for 37 dwellings. The extensive conversion works are now underway, with a steady build-out programme envisaged due to the nature of the works. Completion forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

Demolition of the existing care home could be part of a scheme for whole site. Such works have been proposed in the past, including to provide a new care home to replace the existing facility. This would renew social housing stock with more suitable accommodation. A scheme of 45 residential units was approved in 2015 but lapsed (11/03407/OUT). This also included consent for a 60-bed care home (C2 use). The units in the latter were not to be self-contained flats, so no net gain to stock would result from this aspect. This permission lapsed due to non-implementation. Recently confirmed that a developer is now progressing with a revised proposal and is looking to submit an application shorty. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.</div>

Planning permission secured for a range of works to provide 5 apartments and 1 further dwelling (14/01134/FUL). The proposal involves alteration and conversion of the main listed building to create 5 flats, following demolition of modern extensions.

Opportunity recognised to provide a small infill scheme, potentially at a slightly higher yield, reflecting the setting and surrounding housing. An initial outline permission for an apartment block following clearance of the garage was granted but lapsed (06/00136/OUT). It was after this that the site was cleared. This was necessary following a fire that rendered the structures dangerous, A revised proposal was later made for 5 three-bed terraced houses, but despite being approved this similarly lapsed (14/00679/FUL). The immediate availability of the site is uncertain. It is considered to still have potential in the longer-term, but residential development is forecast later in the plan period.</div>

The eastern section was occupied by Stannington Nurseries, but now comprises of vacant hardstanding following earlier demolitions of the buildings. The western part of the is still occupied by a nursery and garden centre, operated by Birchwood Nurseries. An initial outline application for clearance of the disused Stannington Nurseries site and building of 27 homes was approved in 2015 (15/01760/OUT). This proposal only related to the eastern parcel. Subsequently, a proposal was then granted for an amended scheme of 34 homes (16/03693/FUL). The revised scheme covers a larger area than the initial permission, incorporating both the original site and Birchwood Nurseries to the west, with the remaining buildings on this land requiring clearance. Development now underway and forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

However, this has been cleared at an earlier date following closure of the business. Remediation may be required given the former use. The relatively high yield identified reflects development at an increased density, reflecting the location and nature of a likely flatted scheme. An outline permission for 9 units was permitted but this lapsed without commencement (15/01774/OUT). It is understood that the site has now been sold and a residential scheme is not to be progressed immediately. The immediate availability of the site is uncertain. It is considered to still have potential in the longer-term, but residential development is forecast later in the plan period.</div>

An initial permission for construction of a three-storey building was granted in 2015 (15/01569/CCD). This was to provide floorspace for the library at ground floor with 8 affordable apartments above. This scheme was then amended in 2017 with the ground-floor being altered to provide retail/commercial units instead (17/02423/COU). This was due to the preferred location for the re-siting of the library being changed. Development of 8 dwellings completed in 2017/18.</div>

Identified for having potential for redevelopment through a sensitive conversion project, alongside selected clearance of non-listed buildings. Permission now granted to provide a total of 8 apartments alongside commercial floorspace (15/02603/FUL). The works involve two phases. Firstly, construction of 3-new build homes on land to the rear, following demolition of the coach house and stable block. This is intended as a first phase to the development. Following this, works to the listed building will be progressed. The basement will be converted to a cafe, with the rest of the building to provide 5 apartments. There is already one existing flat (C3) as part of the property, which will be included in the renovation works. So, 7 net additions homes will be provided on completion. Development is now underway and completion is forecast within the next years.</div>

The building is now vacant and available once cleared. Scheme for demolition and redevelopment 6 terraced houses has been permitted (16/02306/FUL). The hall has been part demolished but it is understood that there are complications with the project and work has now halted. As a result, Northumberland Council has submitted two applications for erection of security fencing to make the site safe (19/04685/FUL, 20/00373/FUL). Despite there being no substantive progress to date on the residential aspect of the development, the permission has been implemented through initial site works, so it will not lapse. However, given the context the scheme is not considered deliverable and completion is forecast for the 6-10 year period.</div>

The site is now fully vacant, offering scope for conversion with potential for an element of new-build too. Permission secured to provide 5 dwellings through a mix of new-build, selected demolition, and alteration and conversion of vacant buildings (16/04530/FUL). Works involve demolition of the existing farmhouse and replacement with a new dwelling, demolition of a detached outbuilding to be replaced by 2 homes and a further outbuilding into 2 units. Proposal would result in the net gain of 4 dwellings. However, it is understood that permission has recently lapsed due to non-implementation. Recently confirmed that the landowner still intends to pursue redevelopment. Site not considered deliverable at present but is still considered to offer potential in the medium- to longer-term.</div>

This had been demolished at an earlier date and the site has since been identified for redevelopment. The identified yield is considered fitting given the setting and reflecting nature of a flatted development. An application for construction of 4 flats and 2 maisonettes was permitted in 2017 (17/03099/FUL). Since this approval, the future of the site has been reconsidered. A revised scheme has now been permitted for a retail unit (19/02334/FUL). At present both applications remain extant and either scheme could yet be delivered. However, given the context, a residential scheme is not considered deliverable until further clarification on development intentions, and completion is forecast for the 6-10 year period.</div>

A wide range of facilities had been provided for on-site prior to closure, with an outdoor bowling green also in situ alongside the main building. Demolition of the two redundant buildings and clearance of the remainder of the site required. A higher density scheme would be fitting given the surrounding residential development. An application for building of 51 dwellings has now been permitted (17/00080/FUL). The site has been cleared and the development is now under-construction. Completion forecast within the next 5 years.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Grade II listed Hadrian House located within the centre of Hexham that has had a variety of uses over the years. The main building is a three-storey Georgian townhouse that was altered in 1839, when a large extension was added at the rear. After alteration, the building became a large Wesleyan chapel until 1877 when it became the main Post Office for Hexham. In the 1970s the Post Office relocated and the building was utilised as offices, firstly by the Department of the Environment, and later Northumberland County Council. In recent times it has been a register office but is now vacant and available for redevelopment through sensitive conversion. A higher yield would reflect the central location and the density of the proposed flatted scheme. A permitted scheme for 8 apartments, through alteration and conversion, is now in place (17/01204/FUL). The works would provide 3 apartments on the ground-floor, a further 3 apartments on the first-floor and a single apartment on the second-floor. The basement area would be converted to provide the final flat. Development yet to commence but forecast for completion within the next 5 years.</div>

Now vacant following the relocation of the library to Alnwick Playhouse in 2019. Although not listed, the building is still of heritage significance, and retention is preferred. Dating from 1810, the building had originally been a school until 1921 before being utilised as the library for the town. Available for redevelopment and conversion is considered the most appropriate approach. A proposal for part demolition, alteration, conversion and extension to 4 homes now permitted (19/00078/FUL).

A number of small buildings and containers are present on site, so an element of clearance would be required prior to redevelopment. The rest of the site comprises of hardstanding utilised for open-air storage. Now actively being promoted for redevelopment for a residential scheme by the landowner. An outline application for up to 9 dwellings has been refused (17/03660/OUT). The subsequent appeal was dismissed. Despite this, it is still considered that an appropriate scheme may be possible for the site in the medium- to longer-term, although there are issues to overcome. It is understood a revised proposal for redevelopment will be submitted in due course. Currently considered developable later in the plan period. This could be progressed as part of wider scheme alongside/after the adjacent land (9606). However, the sites are in different ownership and there is no proposal for a wider redevelopment at the current time. Identified as an allocation in the draft Local Plan (submitted May 2019).</div>

The eastern building is warehouse of traditional constriction, currently occupied by an antique furniture restorer. The western part of the site is home to a car repair business, comprising two more modern workshop buildings. These operational businesses are likely to required relocation to new premises. Demolition of the buildings, clearance any necessary remediation of the site would also be required prior to redevelopment. A scheme at a slightly higher yield may be suitable given the central location, potentially through an apartment/flatted scheme. Recently confirmed that the site is not being actively marketed by the landowner, but that future options are being appraised. Currently considered developable later in the plan period.. The site is identified as an allocation in the draft Local Plan (submitted May 2019) and also in the Hexham Neighbourhood Plan (Site H 1-8).</div>

The existing open space and playing fields will be retained, with no intention for development on the greenfield land. The identified yield recognises a conversion of the main listed building. The site is currently in use and is not available in the immediate term.

The building has latterly comprises of one large shop and a smaller unit, alongside associated storage space. The main unit was operated by Spar and also provided the village Post Office, but is now vacant following closure in 2016. The smaller premises have continued to be occupied as a hairdressing salon. The site was owned by the MoD for many years and has been identified in the past as having potential for redevelopment. Demolition would be required prior to such a redevelopment. However, the site was sold in 2019 with the new owner having now earmarked for alternative uses. An application for conversion of the existing retail unit to a cafe has recently been permitted (20/00229/FUL). As a result, this site is no longer available for redevelopment for residential use.

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Area of land at Amble Harbour, currently part vacant and part occupied by car parking facilities. Site has been identified in the past as providing opportunity for mixed-use development. Could potentially offer a highly attractive location for new housing, with a flatted scheme being any option to maximise the use of the setting. Any successful scheme would have to carefully consider the relationship with adjacent uses, particularly the business and operational needs of the harbour. The site is proposed for designation as priority open space in the Local Plan. The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

The western part of the site is occupied by a bungalow and associated land, the central and eastern elements are derelict land previously occupied by commercial uses. This land had a number of uses prior to clearance, included a gym, supermarket and stables, all now cleared. Potential to provide an infill scheme, either in whole or part. If the whole site is redevelopment, demolition of the existing property likely to be part of an intensification scheme. Identified for redevelopment for a number of years. An outline permission was secured in 2003 for construction of 10 homes on the vacant land (03/00250/OUT). This lapsed without a start being made. More recently, an outline application has been submitted for clearance and development of 16 dwellings and is now pending consideration (18/02329/OUT). If permitted and then progressed, the development will deliver 15 net additional homes. This relates to the whole site. If the current application is permitted, the deliverability of development will be reappraised.</div>

The buildings are now surplus to requirements following closure and ae standing vacant. Offers opportunity for a conversion scheme. Two applications for redevelopment have been permitted in 2018 potentially enabling development of 9 flats in total. An application for alteration and conversion of the police station to a veterinary surgery and conversion of former office buildings to create 4 flats has been permitted (18/02051/FUL). An associated application for the alteration conversion of the police station to create 5 dwellings has also been approved (18/02504/FUL). Both proposals are supported living units (C3) providing specialist residential accommodation for vulnerable individuals. Whilst extra support will be provided to residents, these are self-contained flats that constitute as separate dwellings. Either proposal could be delivered, or a combination of the two. As a result, the final yield from development could be 4, 5 or 9 flats on completion, depending on whether the veterinary surgery element is progressed. Development yet to commence but forecast for completion in the next 5 years.</div>

Now surplus to NWL requirements and offers opportunity for redevelopment within the urban area. A proposal would require demolition of a disused covered reservoir and the former pumping station prior to redevelopment. A hybrid application was permitted in May 2019 for a total of 10 dwellings (18/01164/OUT). This includes 6 apartments with full consent and a further 4 units in outline. A detailed application will follow for the rest of the scheme in due course. Development yet to commence but forecast for completion with the next 5 years.</div>

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Cleared land close to Berwick town centre that is comprises of vacant hardstanding, previously used for car parking. This was for the retail unit that previously occupied the adjacent land. However, this shop has now been demolished and a new office development recently constructed in replacement. Residential development on this vacant site could complement this scheme. A higher-density could be fitting given the central location, with a flatted/apartment scheme potentially being appropriate. There is known interest in taking forward a project and the site has recently been sold. Currently considered developable later in the plan period. The site is identified as an allocation in the draft Local Plan (submitted May 2019).</div>

Site has been used for a variety of industrial purposes over the years, including a haulage yard, for vehicle repair and servicing, a coach depot and premises for a skip hire firm. Currently still occupied, so not immediately available, although there may be opportunity for redevelopment for residential use following clearance and remediation. This could be progressed as part of wider scheme alongside/after the adjacent land (9110). However, the sites are in different ownership and there is no proposal for a wider redevelopment at the current time. The current availability of the site is uncertain. There still may be potential in the long-term but no residential development is forecast within the plan period at present.</div>

The site has also been utilised as a scrapyard in the past. Peripheral to Alnwick, being located outside settlement boundary. An application was refused for erection of 1 dwelling on part of site, with the subsequent appeal dismissed (15/02778/FUL). Brownfield element (0.48ha) - indicative yield of around 5 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach, although likely to represent the maximum appropriate.
