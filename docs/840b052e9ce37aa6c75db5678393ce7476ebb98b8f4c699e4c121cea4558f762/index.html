                            <div>Located within Swanley urban confines the site is considered sustainable. The existing access onto Hilda May Avenue could be utilised, subject to the landowner’s consent. A small section of the site is allocated as open space which forms an important part of the green infrastructure network. The loss of this use is not supported and would need to be clearly demonstrated. Overall the site is considered able to accommodate development.</div>
