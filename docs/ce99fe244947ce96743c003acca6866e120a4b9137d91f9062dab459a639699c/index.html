The loss of this use is not supported and would need to be clearly demonstrated.

There is existing access onto Church Street however this is a narrow rural lane and not considered suitable for further development. It is difficult to see how an additional access could be achieved without third party involvement. The site forms part of an open landscape and sits within the AONB. It is considered that development of this site would not conserve or enhance the AONB. The site lies partly within flood zones 2 and 3 and any development proposal would be subject to a flood risk assessment. Further, concerns are raised over any impact development would have on the setting of the adjacent listed buildings and conservation area. Overall the site is considered unsuitable for development given the access issues, impact on the AONB and risk of flooding.</div>
