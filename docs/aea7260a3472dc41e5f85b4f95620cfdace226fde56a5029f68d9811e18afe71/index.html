                            <div>The site is located within the BUAB of Henfield and would be accessed from Station Road. The ground floor of the site is in use as a village store, and is therefore considered to meet the definition of brownfield land. The relatively large plot means that there may be some potential for intensification of residential uses on this site.  The site is in private ownership and will need to be considered as part of the emerging Henfield Neighbourhood Plan.   A scheme of this size would likely be delivered in a single phase</div>

                            <div>The site is located within the BUAB of Henfield and is close to existing services and facilities.  Some of the land is in public ownership and the owners have indicated their willingness for development to come forward, demonstrating that the site is available for development.  There may be potential for this site to be allocated within the Neighbourhood Plan for Henfield.  It is considered that any commercial use or potential loss of parking spaces would need to be considered prior to any development on this site, and as a consequence the likely maximum number of dwellings the site could deliver would be around 6 units. The site is also located in Henfield Conservation Area and the Post Office is a Grade II listed building.  Access to Henfield library would also need to be maintained.   Any development of this site would be likely to take place in a single phase</div>

                            <div>This building is located close to the town centre of Horsham. The lower floor is in retail use occupied by Sussex Lighting. The upper four floors are vacant office space and may therefore be suitable for conversion to residential use. Access would be from London Road.  There is potential for residential use on this site within the next 6-10 years and a scheme of this size would likely be delivered in a single phase.</div>

                            <div>This site is located in the built-up area of Horsham and is accessed from Rusper Road. Planning permission for 24 flats was granted in 2002 for 24 flats, (NH/157/02) but was not implemented. This permission expired in 2010, but the landowner has indicated that they would like the site to remain in the SHLAA, indicating that the land is available for residential development. The site area of this land extends beyond the original planning permission to include additional units.  This extended area increases the potential of the site to 30 dwellings. Given that the permission was not implemented, further work may be required to bring this site forward and the site is considered available and suitable for development 6-10 years. A scheme of this size would likely be delivered in a single phase</div>

                            <div>The site is located within the settlement of Bucks Green and surrounded by linear residential development.  The site is currently used as a public house, however the landowner has expressed an interest to develop the site meaning it is available for development. Any loss of the public house would however need to be considered through the development management process, but a small amount of residential development may be suitable in the longer term provided it is compliant with local policy and does not harm the setting of the Fox Inn which is a listed building. This site will need to be considered as part of the emerging Neighbourhood Plan for Rudgwick</div>

                            <div>This site is located in the Storrington High Street, and is situated in a designated Conservation Area.  At the current time the site is not available for development given the use of the site as a Post Office depot, but it is considered that there is potential for the site to come forward in the next 15 years.  This site is identified as a reserve site in the pre-submission (Regulation 14) draft of the Storrington, Sullington and Washington Neighbourhood Plan and the supporting text in relation to the draft policy indicates that the development would be expected to deliver in the region of 10 dwellings in a Courtyard development.  The shopping frontage would need to be retained as part of any development. In addition to preserving and enhancing the Storrington Conservation area, any development would also need to consider potential impacts on the Air Quality Management Area which has been declared for this part of Storrington.</div>

It should be noted that the application covers a larger area than the allocation as it also includes 15 Crawley Road</div>

The site is located in the built up area of Horsham and is close to services and facilities, so is considered a suitable location for residential development. Although the site owner has indicated that this site is in employment use and not available for residential development at the current time, this site is considered achievable in the longer term.  Part of the site has permission for 33 units (DC/13/1890). The remainder of the site is therefore considered developable in the next 15 years</div>

                            <div>This site was allocated for residential development in Policy 2 of the made Thakeham Neighbourhood Plan. It is located within the built up area boundary of Storrington and an Archaeological Notification Area and a Bat Sustenance Zone. Much of the southern section of the allocated site is covered by a Tree Preservation Order. The Heath Common Design Statement SPD area lies nearby to the east of the site. Future development would need to take these factors into account as appropriate. An outline planning application DC/18/2095 for the demolition of all existing buildings and the erection of 90 dwellings was submitted on 3 October 2018. The outcome will need to be taken into account on any future updates of this register.</div>
