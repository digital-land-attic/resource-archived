Developable site but outside settlement boundary. Brownfield element (0.48ha) - indicative yield of around 5 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach, although likely to represent the maximum appropriate. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 0018) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 1.27ha. Any proposal for development should reflect rural setting. Application refused for change of use from builders yard and stable to a single dwelling on part of site was refused, with subsequent appeal dismissed (15/02778/FUL).</div>

The brownfield element (0.32ha) represents around two-thirds of site - a yield of around 5 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 0280) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 0.96ha.

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Former school site which closed in 2017 and is now surplus to requirements and available for redevelopment. Overall site identified as having potential for 72 homes a total that is reflective of a predominantly residential area. An application for redevelopment is currently pending consideration (19/00500/FUL). This involves a proposal to provide a total of 78 additional residential units across the wider site through conversion of Duke's School to 27 residential apartments and development of 49 elderly living accommodation apartments and 22 residential dwellings. Brownfield element (0.80ha) only relates to the northern part of the site - a yield of around 22 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 0282) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 4.79ha. If permitted, the BF register will be updated to outline a potential yield of 27 units for the brownfield element of the site, informed by the conversion aspect of the current proposal, and the deliverability of the site will also be reappraised.</div>

Another application for 136 dwellings and supporting commercial space remains pending despite being submitted some time ago (12/00512/FUL). Given the long planning history, deliverability of site is uncertain in the immediate future but longer-term potential is still considered to remain.

Mixed in nature but playing fields to be excluded from any proposal and development limited to the footprint of the old school buildings. Brownfield in part (0.21ha) - indicative yield of around 6 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. Previous application was refused for 33 two- and three-bed two-storey dwellings following demolition (17/03961/FUL). This proposal encompassed the whole site, both greenfield and brownfield land. However, this does not prevent a suitable scheme coming forward in the future following a revised proposal being deemed appropriate. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 1518) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 0.91ha.</div>

Despite peripheral setting there is potential for a small-scale residential project through redevelopment of former industrial land. The overall SHLAA site is mixed but the reduced yield indicated recognises a focus on the brownfield parcel. Brownfield element (0.49ha) considered to be suitable for small-scale development - a yield of around 5 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (2379) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 0.84ha. A saved Tynedale Local Plan allocation for 10 dwellings covers part of site.</div>

Saved Tynedale Local Plan allocation for 30 dwellings also covers site . Mostly vacant railway land, adjacent to the Tyne Valley line, with location and setting offering an attractive location for residential development although some constraints are identified. Whilst the previous consent was for up to 50 dwellings, a reduced indicative yield of 30 units is identified in the SHLAA. This is considered appropriate given the setting and site constraints.</div>

The site is identified as an allocation in the draft Local Plan (submitted May 2019) and also in the emerging Hexham Neighbourhood Plan.</div>

Development would have to carefully consider the designation as a Grade II listed building. Permission for development has been granted for 18 homes (17/00884/FUL). This project involves conversion of the listed building to provide 13 self-contained residential apartments alongside development of new-build dormer bungalows. Development is yet to start but is expected to be finished within the next 5 years. A relatively high density is considered to be appropriate, recognising that the majority of the units will be provided through conversion to flats.</div>

Through the SHLAA, a yield of 6 dwellings is identified between two sites (3049 and 3076) with the indicative delivery recorded against the latter. A planning permission relating to the two parcels of land was approved but never implemented and has now lapsed (CM/20090251). This would have seem the demolition of the existing buildings and replacement with 6 new-build apartments. The identified yield continues to reflect a higher density flat/apartment development. Prior to the above proposal, a previous application, also for 6 units, was withdrawn (CM/20080727). Capacity recorded against site 3049.</div>

A hybrid permission (full and outline) is in place for 875 homes (16/00994/FULES). The site is under-construction and it is forecast that delivery will continue over the next 5 years and beyond, with a long-term build-out programme envisaged over 20+ years. Site is a mix of brownfield and greenfield land with the former involving redevelopment of existing buildings. Brownfield element (c.20ha) represents around one-third of the site area - a yield of around 282 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 3074) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 64.51ha. Alongside the residential development, the scheme also includes a wide variety of supporting infrastructure, services and facilities.</div>

A planning application relating to the two sites was approved but never implemented and has now lapsed (CM/20090251). This would have seen the demolition of the existing buildings and a new-build scheme of 6 apartments. The yield identified in the SHLAA continues to reflect a higher density flat/apartment development. Prior to the above proposal, a previous application, also for 6 units, was withdrawn (CM/20080727).

                            <div class="govuk-details__text">Former colliery and brickworks site that offers scope for significant redevelopment but is somewhat peripheral, being located to the other side of the ECML to the rest of the settlement. The site has been subject to a number of applications, including a permitted hybrid scheme that includes full planning permission for a small-scale scheme of 19 dwellings (CM/20090001). This is yet to commence but is forecast to be delivered in the next 5 years. The wider site is an extensive area of land to north of the railway line that may have further potential in the future. The original permission was for 149 units in outline alongside a range of other uses. A variation of conditions application relating to this remains outstanding (17/04653/VARYCO). If this is approved the number of units will increase from 19 to 104. A number of obstacles and constraints are evident that question the wider deliverability and this may be reflected in the smaller proposal recently granted approval. Until housebuilding commences, the site will remain on the BF Register. Wider site is an extensive area of land to north of the railway line that may have further potential in the future. Previous outline consent for 26 homes was not progressed (CM/20061042) and an original proposal for 36 units was refused (05/D/773). The outline permission (CM/20090001) includes consent for combined heat and power plant, enterprise space, allotments and associated open space.</div>

For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 4669) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 1.36ha. Past proposals have suggested a mix of retail, commercial, leisure and residential development. A hybrid application was submitted but subsequently withdrawn (18/04255/FUL). Prior to this, an application for mixed-use development, including 15 new build dwellings and a pub/hotel, lapsed without progress (09/S/00330/OUT).</div>

Mainly brownfield but wider site includes former playing fields. Brownfield land (0.61ha) represents around 25% of the site area - a yield of around 16 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 5059) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 2.39ha. An application for development of 66 homes is currently pending consideration (16/03954/FUL). Identified as an allocation in the Draft Local Plan allocation (Jan 2019). If permitted, the deliverability of the site will be reappraised.</div>

Permitted permission has been granted for a mixed-use scheme (18/01658/REM). As part of wider proposals, this includes provision of 4 dwellings. Development is yet to commence but is forecast for delivery within the next 5 years. The latest application revises the original outline application, which was for up to 12 homes (17/00444/OUT). The application covers a larger area than the SHLAA site, but is focused on mixed-use redevelopment of land within the town centre, and the housing is only a small element of the overall scheme. The permission is primarily for 7,720m2 of additional floorspace for non-residential use (6,800 net), with potential for a wide range of retail, commercial and leisure uses.</div>

Formerly the site of Cambois Colliery and associated railways land, terraced houses and allotment gardens. The site could potentially be part of wider scheme of redevelopment at Cambois, including other sites identified in the SHLAA (5047, 5048 and 5098). Significant constraints to development are recognised. The land has been subject to a number of proposals. An initial outline application for comprehensive mixed-use redevelopment of a wider site (5047, 5048, 5098, 5103) was submitted in 2008 (08/00403/OUTES) This proposal was for remediation of former industrial land followed by construction of 467 homes along with retail and health facilities, care home, combined heat and power facility, roads, car parking and landscaping. A revised proposal was received January 2011 for remediation, construction of 323 houses along with supporting local retail and health facilities, roads and infrastructure. This application remains minded to approve subject to agreement of the S106, but has been outstanding for a number of years.</div>

Located in an established residential area but the site is not available at present. This may change if a decision was made to relocate the education facility. It is likely that an element of the current open space would require retention through any redevelopment proposal. Latest proposal is for a small area of the playing fields to be brought forward. Likely to represent a long-term option, but only an element of the site is likely to be available for redevelopment. Mixed site of both brownfield and greenfield land. Brownfield parcel (3.85ha) represents 50% of the site area but lower yield is reflective of development focusing on the footprint of the existing buildings. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 5147) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 7.63ha.</div>

A yield of around 12 dwellings can be calculated based on methodological approach.

An application for demolition of the school building and replacement with of 24 two- and three-bed dwellings was refused in October 2018 (17/03894/FUL).
